go ask any muslim in pakistan and some parts of middle east they say taliban are talib students of what islam and they are freedom fighters also they are not misinterpretatibg quran quran itself is an ourdated book written by various people that would be called misinterpretation because mohammad was illiterate so he could not write who knows what his follwers wrote what mohammad said what taliban is following is the closest to th century lifestyle and set of laws written by men for men about both men and women pretty sure no opinion of any women was included during the writing of those rules ypu call sharia also have you ever wondered that if islam is being misinterpreted then how come no muslim nation or community follows the true islam because guess what the more secularismfreedom of worshipping for non believers under islamic rule espically idolatry freedom of expressionwomen and gay rights etc the nation is the more it misinterpretes quran and dosent allow the raw teachings of quran to be regarded as a state or nations law because all the things in mentioned above are not included in quran and its kind of opposite in sharia the dimmis and kaafirs have clearly the lowest form of treatment and muslim women are just above that and at the top are all muslim scholars and mujahids just like how mohammad wanted to have this lifestyle forever,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

because talibans are now fighting the other way around than they are used to if possibly there k talibans in baghaln then of course they are not all packed together making easier targets but if we say there is k together that are trying to flee and retake the salang pass then they will be harassed and ambushed multiple times on the way to salang by guerilla fighters probably losing a bunch of fighters and vehicles so at the time they get to salang they might have lost hundreds of fighters remember their vehicles are unarmored and they have very little experiences against hit and runs they will retake the salang pass and run but after that it means no more force in the north and the na will retake it easily if the forces stay they will try to fight but without local support and the locals taking up arms they will be ambushed and killed as they travel so its not a very good prospect for the tb right now without a reinforcementlogistics line the only advantage tb has right now are nvg but all the other technologies are useless and will not outweigh the match against the resistanceedit but that means they already had the time to equip their force with it and have enough competent fighters to use nvg which i do not think they had time for now,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

people forget that afghanistan was a peaceful happy country for decades until the soviets showed up afghanistan has always existed just fine with a weak central government that defers to the individual provinces and ethnic groups to rule themselves no reason that can not work again if all sides realize they can coexist trouble with the taliban is they do not follow that model they want absolute central authority to enforce their way of life cultures and values on everyone strict sharia law is great if that is what you believe but at its heart afghanistan is a very freedom loving country always has been,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

because it is annoying as fuck they act like they are better than us and you westerners believe them wholeheartedly hk and taiwan you have given the hong kongers a pass in everything they have done and what exactly has been done to them by the hk police vs what they have done themselves is a complicated topic but it is indisputable that they are not gandhilike also sinophobic people have been using hong kong as an example of why chinese culture has always been trash and i do not mean modern culture i mean chinese culture since we discovered the yellow river why because hong kong was british for a while they are not better than us nor are they different they are just angry frustrated teens demanding democracy but i can not stress that they are cantonese with a little bit of british a cultural subdivision of chinese taiwan okay just do not say they are a different ethnicity and i am good also do not ever say they are better because they strayed from chinese culture they are better than the prc because they stuck to traditional culture and caught up with the liberalization of governments happening in the west xinjiang and tibet the west just has too many people that try to separate us hans from these other ethnicities that suddenly have perfect morals because they are against the ccp they are not you should honestly treat them like you treated the scottish you did not chant free scotland you just analyzed the situation trying to secede from the uk or catalonia from spain but suddenly everyone is so invested in tibet and the uighurs because of the humans rights abuses demand humane handling but leave the geopolitical dispute to us and them we chinese want tibet and xinjiang to remain as part of china because anytime a country does not split it dodges economic loss while i hate that my country is communist i would like if it was not a communist shithole anymore and tibetans then uighurs fucking off will just because problems dissidents like me would prefer they just do their best to survive until we get a regime change,698.8781626660493,infinity,infinity,infinity
how does it feel knowing hong kong is and always will be a part of china we already knew that the issue was china agreed to respect hong kongs autonomy until they wiped their ass with that agreement like they do with every other agreement it is good to see the world finally realizing agreements with china are not worth the paper they are written on glad to see countries like the uk and others giving hong kongs best and brightest a path out of hong kong as china turns it into an authoritarian shit hole,782.1386620853702,infinity,infinity,infinity

allow me to jump in i have two contentions to your argument thus far i think you are saying that the different presidencies will reach similar to foreign crisis due to the advisement of existing bureaucracy which span across decades but i believe it is the other way around presidents have their own agendas and they will react differently due to their political background but will turn to the bureaucracy to see what is the best way to carry out those visions for examples ikes operation ajax nixons operation rolling stone and reagans irancontra were all fundamentally different from their predecessors in terms of strategic objectives and degree in violation of international laws trump may or may be show a similar degree of interest towards the chinataiwan situation i frankly do not believe trump listens to advises at least not to a degree that you think how similar other presidents were you are right that obama is probably similar to say clinton and the bushes in terms of listening to foreign affair advisors but trump is a different bred first he has already showed he is not listening to bureaucratic advises in the dealing with the state department homeland security defense department and even within the white house staff tillerson mattis nielsen kelly at least the three former cabinet members resignedfired due to disagreement on policies in nielsens case it was a matter of constitutional violation sorry i just do not see trump as someone who would act due to advises rather he would seek advises so he can act on his own agenda,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

fine you want to talk about it then dont hate me for speaking my mind since you asked for it here is the full reply that you seem to demand from me geezus it is good that you at least admitted that us has strategic ambiguity there is a reason for that it is just a way for both parties to have a ceasefire but not yet finalise anything or conclude the civil war so they can continnue to run their economies and finish the fight later on so legally speaking i do not see taiwan as being a full independant country and do not appreciate partisan gaslighting they are at best a defaco country considering their status is still being decided by a civil war the reality is that the us does not have ultimate power over other countries domestic affairs they wanted taiwan to take over china way back in the s but they relaised that the mainland today is just not easily defeated if anything it seems pretty clear that chinas military is increeaisnly able to defeat taiwan these days you can say that taiwan is an indepednatn soverign state republic of china and you can argue this all you want saying that the civil war does not exist and that the chinese civil war is actually a myth and propaaganda created by china except i am bloody aussie mate and not a dumb cunt so do not treat me as one and think you can fool me into thinking the civil war does not exist it only works on people who are completeley unfamiliar with the topic even though i see myself as neutral expat doing business in guanzhou and also studied mandarin in taipei i never once pretended that taiwan is part of peoples republic of china nor did i ever pretend that taiwan is a full country without dispute i jus see things as they really are and ignore the spun propaganda so do not try to bs me you will not change my mind and i am not interested in reading your arguments that is just honestly gaslighting which i dont appreciate this is what i know and understand china and taiwan are at civil war china won the first major one and hence the un rewarded china with the seat at the un and kicked taiwan out however taiwan has still not been fully defeated however china has a legal right to finish their civil war and take taiwan by un charter laws people saying that taiwan is an indepedant country it is fine you can say that all you want but the reality still is going to remains that it is not an official recognised fact that the civil war has ended just stratgeic ambuigity to enable a ceasefire for now i do not recognise that taiwan is part of chinayet i see taiwan as separate for now but i also see civil war as never legally ended and i learn the history from my wife who is a sinophile that chiang kaishek was actually from the mainland shocker i know lol and his mainland gov was challenged by the rebels and he was defeated however not completely he fled to taiwan took a lot of gold and treasuires with him and holed up in taiwan which was already part of china back then the chinese tried to finish the civil war but lacked a proper navy after years they have been buildng up their navy to finsh the civil war legally under un charter laws the civil war has never ended and they can invade taiwan as long as taiwan has not resolved the chinese civil war they are a de facto independant run state at best but never a full indepednat countr that is just reality and not going to pretends it is anything else because of people political stances deep down you know the civil war is ongoing and that means that taiwan can never be a fully indepdant and internaionally eecognised country unless the civil war has been resolved so do not give me your intellectual arguments aimed to change my mind i am not one of those people who hate china and hence pretend they have no right for a civil war that is the definition of brainwashing so do not send me another reply unless you actually admit that taiwan s status is still affected by civil war cos i am not having it,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

it will not be monumentus but look at it a different way firstly there will be an awareness increase that is an easy one but additionally think of the afghans in amsterdam and holland in general they may feel more supported particularly if they still have family there peoples actions towards because support are often heavily judged as though you either have to solve the problem or do nothing its ok to contribute to any effectsunfortunately in my experience people who are most likely to criticise protests marches or whatever else which do not have a direct effect are the least likely to do anything at all this may not be you and sorry to imply thatedit another example imagine being even in afghanistan and seeing that cities around the world are watching supporting and flying a flag you can no longer fly yourself that is got to feel good does it solve the problem obviously not i doubt anyone at this march feels like they are fixing the issueedit fixed a few words which made no sense,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

imagine if you will you are the child of a businessman the town you grew up in is nothing special even lacking in a few areas but there is still a sense of local pride you are father encourages you all your life to be studious and seek a respectable job time goes by and you find a job at a local government office as you work there your local area undergoes development and the local economy improves the look of the town all your family and friends you knew at school seem to be doing well a practice arises where local criminals names are broadcast to the public you do not think much of it you were never encouraged to think about these things at most you reckon well it serves them right i can not imagine why anyone would do such a thing to their own community you move on with your life a decade on and you have climbed up the ranks due to your reputation as a hard worker and some contacts on your fathers part you now work in an office that oversees the entire region of the country your town resides in you find out a large portion of the region is militarized land you never knew that well there is garrisons all over the country only stands to reason at home your once small town is practically a small city all thanks to government funding and you feel you played no small part in the matter you lost contact with some friends but that is okay as everyone does and the friends and family you still have are great you are even engaged to a fantastic partner life could not be better the local shaming practice extends to minor offences such as public indecency and not paying bills the cheek of some people another decade goes by you have a beautiful daughter a loving wife and have been promoted to the position of ambassador leading up to this point you have been informed of worldly affairs a brief background on other countries you would only heard about by name until now and information as to why part of the region you lived in is militarized a small republic had agreed to join the peoples republic of china in the past but religious extremists choose to incite violence holding the authority of their theistic bedtime stories above leadership of your fine country this is the reasom why that area you had never heard about is militarised to keep the peace you do not think about the fact that you never knew the town you grew up in was not always a part of china you were not taught to question it all this information is learned through memos provided to you by the government they sure take vetting seriously round here you do your duty to your country you are living abroad with your family with your own security team provided by your government your job is to explain complex internal affairs in simple ways that foreigners can understand you have been told to dispel any misinformation circulated by foreign governments looking to sabotage the unity your country has worked so hard for you never think to take any of this misinformation as truth you were not taught that your government could do anything wrong but let us say you notice that there is security cameras in places that seem entirely unnecessary why would ypu question it you hear one of your pld school friends disappeared without a trace after trying to undermine local laws seems reasonable you hear of a man that tried to flee the country after commiting a serious crime and the police force threatened to detain his family if he did not turn himself in perhaps a tad extreme but you know the police they would never actually go through with it its just doing what needs to be done better not dissapoint your government now they might pretend threaten your family too you hear noncombatants are being detained in the militarised area a tragedy but it can not be helped they did not suppress their own neighbours from violence after all complicit in a crime is just as bad as commiting it so when you are asked to interview by the foreign news corporation that does not censor malicious lies and rumors about this complicated issue in your region you try your best to explain it in simple terms the region is beautiful and grade place to life in the democratic republic of china the moment you were born to hanchinese parents you were already up to your kneck in a system which encourages conformity and discipline and discourages critical thinking and empathy this is the nature of china under beijing,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

the united nations do not even recognise taiwan as its own country but a part of china after the roc lost the chinese civil war in the mainland if china invades then legally the un charter prohibits any country from coming to taiwans defense the only reason why china has not is because war on taiwan and the damage they would do would not be ideal they however would not allow taiwan to declare independance so war is only most likely if taiwan actually declares independance if they do not the status quo will continue as it has for the last decades not all of taiwan is proindependence either some want peaceful reunion whereas others want independence regardless it is still a domestic matter among the chinese in which china does have a legal right under international laws to claim taiwan and conclude the chinese civil war despite they already won officially back in s but america interferes as they need a proxy regarless unless taiwan wins the civil war or the un recognises it as its own country and there are solid reasons why that will not really convince me that they are an international recognized country,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

the rest of asia spoke chinese for quite a few centuries we do not live in the th century we live in the st century the rest of asia does not speak chinese now so how is that germane japan still have high regards for the tang dynasty japan is divesting from china now tang dynasty high regard notwithstanding japan korea and vietnam historically all branched off china in terms of culture i would like to hear what japan korea and vietnam say about their roots in china i doubt it dovetails so neatly give japan and korea their sovereignty back and see who they would aline themselves with south korea and japan are not sovereign today you really think a majority of south koreans and japanese prefer china over the west both of those countries waged literal war with china how are they allies also ask any ordinary africans how they feel about white people it is all in the books true but this does not mean their anger and distrust of whites translates into friendship and trust with china it is possible to distrust more than one entity africans fury at china is raging now and this is not impacted one bit by their distrust of whites if china had a chance to ally with africa in solidarity against the west that opportunity died with the virus outbreak and racism against black africans in guangzhou the south china sea contains crucial trade routes for china and you would expect china to just have absolute influence there china does not assert influence they assert total control like the us gets to protect freedom of navigation by not signing in with unclos the us acts on behalf of its own interests but also in conjunction with the other asian nations who have a better claim to the south china sea than china in fact china has the weakest claim among all asian nations the spratly scam will turn out exactly the same as chinas efforts in africa a costly misfire you can not simply consolidate the ccp into a unified body of pure malice and claim that they did not do the bad things simply because they wanted but could not i can not decipher this sentence,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

ha but this is not privilege or anything like that talking i am speaking more in terms of judging how chinas leadership acts they bully countries that they see as weak in the international economy and political order and they see canada is big enough to matter but small enough to get away with occasionally taking pot shots at hence the canadians who have been detained tortured and threatened with death in reaction to the huawei lady getting arrested in canada since it is in reaction to an american extradition request in principle you would think that they would have retaliated by trumping up charges against american nationals in china but they have not because they see the us as too powerful economically and politically to screw with in that way it makes for a strange reversal actually in the s i knew americans who when they traveled to europe would put a canadian maple leaf on their backpacks because they did not want to deal with europeans bugging them about whatever george w bush was up to or the latest war on terror catastrophe in iraq generally canadians had an easier time when it came to international travel than their american counterparts but now in china you are probably much safer if you are an american than if you are a canadian,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

that might be me i have been making posts about american occupation in afghanistan and that is been one of my primary points of contentionin my mind i would say that five years would have been enough to allow the younger generation to start entering into the military and government with over six million people entering into adulthood in the next five years that would provide them with a chance to show their worth and their compatriots to strengthen the government so that a collapse like we have seen might not have happened the children of the st century were those that held the future of afghanistan and staying until would have allowed them to come up in enough numbers to defend the republic if they were willing to do so since we were only spending billion a year with operation freedoms sentinel less than one percent of our total revenue for a year back in and since our losses have been comparatively small to nearly every american war the costs would not have been heavy for how much good it could have accomplished,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

chinese do not understand that there are more than one country out there my parents are russian i have swedish passport and i live in indonesia i do not give a fuck about ccp agenda to make usa look bad i know they are but nothing out there compares to shit gymnastics ccp is doing that is the viewpoint of the whole world they can not blame america because nobody give a fuck about their complains do not skip the line they inherently do not understand how freedom of speech works it does not matter if you have something good or bad to say what matter is the conversation itself if you want to exposed some statistic about ex rape on campus it does not matter if you say there is not enough rape or there is to much rape the conversation will be about rape and the truth will be exposed that is the point of conversations in free society ccp shills do not understand that when they are pouring opinions into the pot they just provide more fuel to the fire the more they talk the more they expose ccp the more they talk the more badstupid they make china to look ccp should be embarrassed about their trolls when americans say something patriotic but stupid about america it is embarrassing but there are people who can prove them wrong and make it balanced but when a stupid ccp shill says something patriotic and stupid to the point where it is embarrassing to the whole china there is nobody to point it out because it is illegal to say anything bad about ccp it is a conversational spiral that bound to china look bad if you shit on the street and people see it you can not just talk your way out of it or start conversations on reddit saying i did not shit on the street that is barbara streisand effect that is a metal ability of a year old i did not eat the cookie but you where the only one who could the way to fix the problem is to clean up and make sure you will never do it again acknowledging mistakes and fixing them is a strength ccp do not posses this strenght in their arsenal if you pretend to support the opposite view chinese are inherently scared to say anything bad about ccp them arguing with americans about anything will just end up being pro america also ccp shills do not understand that modern world have a deep history of trolling we are used to seeing offensive shit even on television in contrast ccp can not even handle south park how the fuck are they going to try and use trolling to make ccp look good they are bound to just shit in a bag and hyperventilate their propaganda until it comes out of their eyes and ears and then what people will just flush the whole thing instead of just that shitty part we know that there are some shitty people in china but the more trolls try to argue the more people will dismiss china as a whole instead of seeing it as a separate issue if somebody high up makes a racist decision it would have stayed as a racist decision by that person but because trolls insist on having a discussion it makes it clear that the problem is not with that particular individual the problem is the ccp itself ccp trolls inherently make china look bad and if they write something bad about america because they found a flaw that is perfect the more flaws about america or other countries that gets exposed the faster we can fix them and make a better world the rest of the world actually want and need to expose weaknesses that is why ccp trolls will never win an argument when i say ccp pp smol i already won the whole battle,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

so i kind of get the historical explanation but i want to see how someone in contemporary chinese society can work their head around the obvious logical errors in their thinking as you mentioned many chinese consider that china is on top but how can they simultaneously hold the view that china is the greatest country on earth whilst also believing that china can only succeed by stealing foreign ideas do they not understand that if you need to cheat or steal to succeed then it heavily implies that you were never good enough to reach that level by yourself how can one be so proud of oneself if one has to acknowledge ones own inferiority also do people not understand that actually cheating is not helping china at all the whole world can see when the ccp plays dirty tricks and it only serves to give china a very bad global reputation it is not that the world is too weak to stop china from cheating or too stupid to notice its just that the world has been very tolerant of china up until quite recently in the hope that they would continue to improve living standards in the country but if the ccp continues to act with arrogance and hostility then they will find that suddenly the world is not so willing to look the other way for their sake one thing i have always noticed that is very deeply rooted in chinese society is this kind of shortsightedness with a stubborn insistence to only focus on shortterm gains i honestly find that chinese people have a very difficult time thinking through the longterm consequences of their actions and can see no further than how their actions immediately benefit themselves and their families even if such actions would cause you ruin just minutes later,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

if your definition of suppressing information is that media does not cover it then we have a different definition of suppressing information the event was years ago and i doubt any media would cover it after and the usage of the internet was not even popular until in china well one of the examples from the definition of information suppression is biased or selective representation of sourcesthat appears to be exactly what is happening here on baidu they do not report it today for the same reason why the bonus army massacre is not reported it is not news and no one cares anymore a brand new word for you history i think you will find we have articles talking about events from way way before tiananmensurprised you had no idea about that i thought the argument was that the cpc suppresses information how moronic the cpc would have to be to suppress information by displaying everything there is to know in a chronology the most unbiased way you can record an event unbiased lol the ccp about tiananmen yeah i bet they said it was a huge mistake on their part and had great humility in their article and super unbiased results in baidu with every result not certified by the ccp completely and utterly removed i do not see how they can be any more impartial i have already demonstrated my coherency in english yes especially the part about adding a lot of padding on to my back what is this is this what you classify as a coherent english sentence yes it is a perfectly fine sentence grammatically use this and you will see go over there and you will find it etc etc post it on some english learning forum and see if they say it is incorrect your guess is wrong the point is not about your arguments being fallacious it is about your intentions and actions only arguments can be fallacious you intentionally manipulated the idea of suppressing information from preventing people from knowing about it to what i assume limiting its distribution channel that is literally the definition of information suppressionpreventing people from knowing a certain thing or fact ie that website is not in the list of results on baidu all of this stupid point about suppressing information is ignoring the fact that vpn is the most accessible thing in china only behind public washrooms but i do not need to argue this point because what we have is enough to debunk your claim that is a dumb statement in so many ways you obviously have not been to china in about years if you do not know that it is getting more and more difficult to get a vpnand not to mention the fact that you do need one more than of the population do not have oneso yes if you need a vpn most people will not see that informationthus the information has been suppressed you are like the black knight from monty python the holy grail you would not admit defeat even with every one of your arguments torn into pieces which are clearly demonstrated here i will give you credit for continuing with it despite all your ad hominem excuses to run away like brave sir robin so far your argument is information suppression by definition as i quoted above somehow does not constitute information suppression according to you sorry but that is not even a flesh wound so far no i meant exactly what i said i am powerless to stop the spreading of lies and i will not continue this waste of time you do not have ccp resources they can easily stop the spread of information if you do reply again and do not in fact do your brave sir robin impression please also include some links to people chatting about tiananmen on weibobecause it is not suppressed right,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

that is entirely false there are several geopolitical narratives that are playing out at once and geopolitical objectives that the western policymakers hope to achieve that are far more complex than the average citizen assumes take a look at all the foreign policy statements and foreign policy directives released by western think tanks over the last several years the common theme of containing china and russia can clearly be seen then take a look at their directives on gaining a foothold in central asia and rolling back china and russian spheres of influence in the region its clear they were not able to defeat the tb so they made a deal with them and allowed them full control of the area that will create destabilization within the central asian countries through three main conduits which have already been established destabilization via refugees destabilization via narcotics destabilization via the spread of the fanatics from afgin the long run this is not a win for china at all to fully exploit afg minerals a tremendous amount of infrastructure needs to be built and this has not been feasible whatsoever in preceding decades china does not benefit from having a theocratic state directly on its border with xinjiang a province which has seen unrest in the past due to the cultural and religious makeup of the province,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

actually big corporates like to do business in big protected markets in a totally free market anyone can try to enter into your line of business if competitors make the exact same product and quality it is resulting in less competitive advantage you have over your competitors and in an ideal free market the only way you can compete is by lowering your price up to the point neither one of you is making a profit but if you are a big company and you are the only one that gets a licence to operate in that niche of the industry you can protect your market share by paying enough bribes to the government not to give any licenses to people who want to enter your market niche so when dealing with a government that restricts market entry and you are the first one to break into a market to get a head start and establish yourself you will be laughing to the bank,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

it seems this notion that afghanistan has no national unity is at least somewhat false just looking at the taliban its clear they see afghanistan as a nation since they aim to take it over before them there was of course the communist government and the monarchy which both saw afghanistan as a nationi think the situation is more akin to the united states pre civil war people are more fond of their state or in afghanistans case their tribe but do understand the concept of a nation and that they are part of one,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity
as a native bhutanese i would like to say that we do have our flaws poverty is a problem in some parts of the country nepotism and corruption do exist teens do commit sucide due to depression and all of the vices that is almost immisible with the very nature of humanity do exist here but to a lesser extent partly because we have a smaller population so there is less struggle for resources a bit of darwinism here and hence a smaller crime rate there is also a lack of organized crime in bhutan though you may hear of bhutanese smugglers caught smuggling this thing or that in certain airports usually india bangkok etc the smugglers themselves are often paid by some organisers and and are not a part of some criminal organisation based in bhutan we did have some gangs mb boys being the most notorious before like in the s but the police seem to have done a good job in dismantling them corruption and nepotism do exist but it does not exist in a sustainable manner like in some countries india nepal bangladesh to name a few partly because most of these perpetrators are greedy opportunists who lack much foresight and partly becaus the agencies that we have to counter such crimmes are quite efficient and do not let such criminal blights to take root in the system xd xd xd most of the crimes that occur are to do with some form of violence the bhutanese are quite hot headed at times specially those from the west and alcohol flows quite freely in our veins or petty thievery violence against women is an issue specially in the rural areas and things do seems to be getting better but there is still a lot left to do as for the lgbtq there are only a handful of them and there is not much discrimination against them sure they will raise a few eyebrows wherever they go but this is because there are so few of them most stay somewhere near the capital where things are a bit westernizedglobalizedand with that comes the western liberal view of sexuality in short sexuality is not much of an issue with most bhutanese so we do not bother much with who does what with whom you may find murals of holy protective penises on walls but these murals have less of a sexual connotation and more of a symbolic onethere is also a bit of tantric influence herexd xd as for our monarchs we are very lucky to have them and i mean this honestly i do concede that it is not entirely untrue to say that there is a bit of propaganda in a very loose sense of that word to paint the royals in a good light but i think this is justifiable because firstly people on average are not very bright and often lack coherence look at the current state of most true democracies in the world if you do not believe me so in the long run they may lack forsight and often because a distruption to the flow of progress due to civil unrest you may argue that such disruptions due to civil unrest are not as bad as i believe them to be and are infact quite necessary this may be true for other countries but for a tiny country like bhutan lodged between two giant and sly nations any form of civil unrest must be avoided or properly diffused in order to protect our sovereignty so i believe a propaganda is required to unify the opinion of the masses on certain topics the intellectual minority that do exist here as they do elsewhere would i believe opt not to act greedily for their own benefit and harm the nation as they will be under scrutiny of the royal who have the support of the public the royals are not all powerful though they may have influence over the masses opinion on certain topics but the are limited in their power by the constitution the king may be the head of the state and decide who to grant citizenship to but the government both local and centralized are democratically elected and controlled most matters it is similar to what they have in uk but the people like the royals a bit more so they have more influences and our house of lords called the national council is not filled with aristocrats xd xd secondly i say that we are lucky to have such royals because that is true had they been the wrong sort of royals the public would not have liked them it does seem a bit sad to think that people in other countries who might have been so cheated by their own royals find it so difficult to believe in the existence of a genuinely good king who does care about his people and country the royals serve another purpose too they provide the masses with moral support specially in times of crisis such as this it is for these reasons that i feel the saccharine propaganda if you could even call it that of the royals is justified looking at the state that our country is in currently compared to our neighbours who are in quite a pinch due to the ongoing pandemic i think you will find that the public is not wrong to appreciate such royalsxd xd as for racism yes it does exist here too like it does everywhere infact it is existence is expected given the faliablities of humanity and the presence of two clearly distinct ethnic groups the ethnic caucasoid and ethnic mongoloid with visibly but not symbolicmore on this later different religionculture but it is not currently doing the country much harm and efforts are being made to homogenized the two it is usually the rural areas wher most racist thoughts prevail since these communities are usually made up of people of a single ethnicity hence they are more prone to think in terms of us and them even within these two distinct groups there is a bit of discrimination based on class and caste but these issues stay within lounges over cups of tea or a glass of wine or around the fireplace after a good days work people do believe in stereotypes but this does not because anyone much trouble since publically acting out on these racist thoughts would bring the publics attention to the perpetrator and they will be punished for acting out this is because we bhutanese have a strong sense of morality when judging others or atleast some vocal bhutanese do and so racism is prevented from being institutionalized xd xd another aspect of bhutanese culture that might seem peculiar to others is how happy we claim we are it is true that bhutan is a peaceful country we are not at war with anyone people are well taken care of healthcare and education are free ahem ahem murica ahem these and a lot more are what you are general told but i would like to point out a few other reasons for our happiness firstly both the major religions that you may find in bhutan vajrayana buddhism and hinduism are rather philosophical in practice and their philosophy is one of nonviolence antimaterialism you will not find any hindu who follows the philosophy of lokayata here and one that is centred around finding hapiness not all bhutanese are religious but the moral values that these two religions emphasizes do seem to trickle down and take root in the minds of most bhutanese on this note the current king has taken initiatives to preserve both of these religions and he seems to be quite a devotee of shiva shaivism shares a lot of similarities in it is philosophy with the form of tantric buddhism practiced in bhutan another reason that the bhutanese are so happy is because of their simplicity in thought and their innocence sure there are a few sly foxes and snakes but they do not seem to be able to induce their shrewdness onto other bhutanese life is less stressful here so people have not the need to burn themselves down to the last shreads of humanity to struggle to deceive others for their survival some may find the bhutanese speech to be one that is quite slow this may be the product of a sedated life since life is quite stress free here compare to elsewhere but this is a generalisation and there will always be a few exceptions we are a merry lot because most of us have not seen the true depravity of humanity xd xd and the reason that you were taken outside the city centres might be because it is the agenda of the tourism board to mesmarize you with the beautiful landscapes and peculiar culture sure they could let you vist the cities if you could call them that but it is not there that we have the best to offer and there is also the danger of certain tourists spoiling the urban youths drugs sex tourism the like so one has to act cautiously besides that the tourism board might have wanted to be more hospitable and pamper you by relieving you of some of the decision and choosing things for you so that you could better enjoy the experience here you see a misunderstanding between two cultures on that note any sort of tourism would have to put up a faade an idea of what they are trying to sell reality is far to complex to fit into such neat descriptionsxd xd bhutan is not the happiest place i do not know how you would even measure happiness but the conditions that should keep a person happy are well fulfilled here,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

on the picture it shows a who logo slapped onto the womans ass why is it so because people think who is distancing itself from usa and is allowing it to be taken advantaged no sexual connotation of by xjp or by extension the ccp the first question i would ask as an apolitical observer is why is it wrong for who to praise a country when they had the quickest and most efficient response thus far responding in days first case detected on december to nationwide response on january especially when it is the country where covid originated despite it not being transparent enough notably february and april which had a spike in daily infections and deaths respectively the who team who were permitted access into wuhan then the epicenter of the outbreak are westerners and the directorgeneral of who is ethiopian they are from capitalist anti communist nations thus pledging zero allegiance to china and have no reason to be accused as ccp shills or communist bootlickers proponents of the china wanted covid to spread to europe and america argument and the like ignore the fact that china alerted who on decemeber and china briefed usa japan and a few other countries cdcs on january about the mysterious virus and have announced that they have identified the new virus on january first making it public that a coronavirus epidemic is spreading in china in addition if we could pause and think for a moment why would china willingly allow the virus to spread when it is apparent to all that inaction would only hurt their economy and the economies of other countries globally slowing down trade further damaging chinas economy i feel that linking corporations organizations and people to ccp due to possible mistakes that were committed in the recent five years may not do justice for the good they may bring in my country we value free speech and we believe in viewing events objectively and not skewed according to our beliefs edit i did expect to be downvoted and indeed i was but do note that downvoting or upvoting do not make you more correct i am open to constructive feedback since i might have been influenced to a limited extent by externalities like the press however most of the online news articles are anticommunist and others once again i repeat the facts stated may sound probeijing but facts are facts and no one can change history so that is all i guess,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

i tried to understand there might be a little bit of a language barrier i think the point you are trying to make is that china is painted in a bad light and it is not all true and many people live happily in china not enslaved and live their lives fine my only thing is that china has been an authoritarian country for thousands of years even before communism china was always based on hierarchy and a monarchy therefore chinse culture has always lent itself to being a very orderly society that responds well to very strong government intervention and control the thing is i do not care what the media says about china i see what they are doing and make my own decisions based on it i live in the united states and i also disagree with many things going on in this country as well but many people disagree and we are marching in our streets demanding change and we are getting change and next year we can even have a different president to help foster than change even further go and disagree with your government and see what happens,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

i do not need to google when the bbfc publish the rules freely in their website it is just not true you can read their own report they publish one every years and adjust things if they are not working out i studied media i had talkslectures by the bbfc this whole rumour started recently but it is never been the bbfc guidelines why do not you google the guidelines for yourself and stop reading them rd hand the bbfc are transparent industry body they publish everything they review on their website they explain what was cut and why it was cut it is not that i have not heard of it because it was cut it just does not actually happen the bbfc are also independent with the government by framing the argument by being about porn etc rather than the fact that it is completely fucking impossible for the bbfc to accomplish this and what will that end up actually meaning will happen which is the real scary thing here it makes me wonder why the independent and the guardian keep making this argument the problem here is that this type of law will only lead to the government going the bbfc can not do its job so we have to take over because it can barely handle things as is the bbfc has strongly resisted control by the government in the past and has repeatedly said it does not want to make its restrictions any stronger the government want control of this and i feel like this is a way to stir hate against the bbfc so the government can take full control of what they do they cut barely anything ever seriously it has to be pretty bad to get cut and there is no such thing as a four finger rule because each video has to be reviewed by an actual person all the way through and they make a judgement most of theses guys days are watching porn i wanted to work for the bbfc once so i know a bit about it i am completely against this law that the independent is talking about but it is hard to defend them when they are outright lying and twisting the truth like they are in that article,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

of course people will talk according to their ideological leaningsbiases the truth is that no faction blue or green is eager to tip the scales of the statusquo balance right now even the ostensibly more proroc blue faction is okay with maintaining that stance while continuing to enjoy having a chance every four years to rule taiwan a chance that it definitely will not get either under ccp rule or under some hypothetical francestyle reunified china where the provincial level receives relatively little autonomy also even hardcore prounification blues do not equal ccp sympathizers that is a very blackandwhite absolutist and dualistic the only split is between pro and antireunification way of looking at the world like i said before blues who focus on taiwan want themselves to be the ones in charge blues who focus on some fanciful reconquista of the mainland also want themselves to be in charge of this newly liberated china either way the history and ideologies of the blues ie nationalist party versus the ccp are too fraught for any true blue to want the ccp to be involved in any of their reunification plans,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

so i am not bhutanese so this may have holes that i would welcome other people to fill in i studied abroad in bhutan and also lived in an area of the us with a large bhutanese refugee populationxd xd in the early s i think unrest in nepal led to many refugees fleeing and settling in bhutan eventually integrating into communities they were bhutanese most only spoke dzongkha and sometimes english like most bhutanese but kept many of their cultural and religious customs from nepal where hindu and buddhism blend for most families this included cultural dress and religious holidaysxd xd in the nineties as bhutan began to modernize and step into the global stage government became increasingly concerned about their national identity their relationship to china has obviously been contentious since the tibetan genocide and other small countries in the region like sikkim nepal are in cycles of unrest or in sikkims case annexed bhutans perspective was that preservation of a firm consistent and unique national identity would bolster their value on the worlds stage and prevent overthrow invasion etc among the laws they passed to ensure this were things like the national dress law which required bhutanese to wear traditional clothing in lots of different contextsi think at school and work and on holidays especially but also it might still be a law that any piece of media that gets internationally distributed that depicts bhutanese life requires all participants to be in national dressxd xd this conflicted with the religious and cultural customs of the oncenepalese population in the south of bhutan and things became very contentious very quickly anecdotally there were horrific atrocities taking placebeheadings and murders of activists and brutal responses to the nonbhutanese cultural dress beyond the earth and sky by jaime zappa goes into it a little bitshe was in the country for some of the activity the somewhat tepid reasoning i was given when gently asking about thisnot while i was in the countrywas that the bhutanese government did not want nepal to be able to make a cultural claim to bhutanese soil as india did to sikkim go figure they failed to mention that sikkim went through a whole overviewit was presented to me as they were absorbed for failure to have a national identity distinct from india which is not quite true xd xd the bloodiness of this conflict almost entirely perpetrated on the nepalese descended bhutanese escalated attracted some attention on the world stage and the government cut their losses and expelled every last one from the country people who had lived almost a hundred years peacefully alongside ethnic bhutanese who knew of no other home were forced out many settled in cleveland where i lived a while and are still struggling immensely to find financial support integrate and understand american customs and english etc their communities are wracked with poverty and obviously the terror and violence they endured before being expelled from bhutan is still very much living memoryxd xd i loved my time in bhutan and i think it is a marvelous countrycertainly as an american i can not throw stones but it would be a mistake to award the minister who made most of the decisions and perpetuated this violenceessentially erasing an entire hybrid culture and a chapter of bhutanese historywith any sort of esteem in time i truly hope bhutans position on all of this will become apologetic and with an eye toward reparationsthe bhutanese diaspora still needs them they certainly have a different rhetorical approach to tibetan refugees i have hope but not when the country allows this event to be glorifiedxd xd edit did some reading that might help your googling the expelled group are called the lhotshampa and their exile took place from the late eighties to something like were forced out which is like a sixth or a seventh of bhutans total population i was also wrong above many of the lhotshampa knew no dzongkha only nepali and english and one measure the government took was to remove nepali as a language of instruction,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

to reiterate you think there is nothing wrong with two adult authority figures shaming a child into hating her own name that her parents chose for her with a beautiful meaning behind it because it may sound like a bad word in mandarin and in the future ethnic minority people should choose names based not on what those names mean within the context of their own culture but based on how they sound to mandarin speakers thus placing the onus of ethnic minorities to conform to han standards rather than for han chinese to become more openminded toward other cultures and the different sounds of their languages oh and punishing kids with threats of verbal abuse and corporal punishment for speaking their native language amongst peers of their own culture in their own native lands is okay because there is no other possible way to promote a national language than to drive the native language into irrelevancy by force,1225.8953861231425,infinity,infinity,infinity

good points although i do not understand your point about geopolitics not being viable or relevant to uschina relations perhaps elaborate on that maybe your point is that geopolitics is not everything and there are major ideological factors and other nonzero sum factors like economics yes yes and yes but those three things ideology geopolitics and economics are not always in harmony china represents a case where you can be rich or free in your relationship with them pick one you can be rich and submit to the communist party or you can make money elsewhere and be free as an american my nature is to be free or die but i think everyone feels the same the chinese people themselves are essentially hostage to a totalitarian police state the previous video link i sent was a lecture here is a debate instead httpsyoutubeorltvbnxhq in the debate you hear a clear ultimatum for australia but again it is applicable to every country in the world either get rich with china and submit to their domination or be free but one other thing to consider the us is the global hegemon and it will not back down from china so if you pick money over geopolitical liberty then you will be an enemy of the us the choice is yours i highly recommend that debate speaking of the money yes china is large and you can make money there india is large too south america is large africa is large we do not need cheap labor from china in order to have a first world society we need to shift industry from the totalitarian communist police state that wants to dominate the world in its image or suffer the consequences it is that simple and to our earlier conversation obama dropped the ball no democratic candidate is even aware of the problem with front runner biden literally copacetic with our current relationship with china httpswwwgooglecomampsampscmpcomnewsworldunitedstatescanadaarticlechinagoingeatourlunchjoebidendismisses i voted for obama twice then i voted for trump twice soon because of china china china if you want to know just how pervasive china is in the us i highly recommend this the story of the same in every country we need to wake up httpsyoutubeohkadnik httpsyoutubeqxqhebdm httpsyoutubegutkebgek regarding europe europe has been a bad ally to the united states regarding china russia nato and trade not only does the us essentially subsidize european security but in return europe wages trade war against the us everyday sort of like china but not as bad or illegal but europes state industrialization policy has crushed lots of industry in the us while taking advantage of us openness all the while failing to meet nato requirements failing to address russia in ukraine or elsewhere even failing to prevent genocide in their own backyard in bosnia for some reason the us had to do that too the notion that the us is the bad guy for just barely reciprocating some trade protectionism is ridiculous right now europe is basically a protectorate of the us we do not want that we want allies we protect germany from russia while they wage state industrial policy against us and while they increase their reliance on russian gas we protect eu from china while it buys chinese g technology i think it plainly true that the us has been badly taken advantage of by europe in the ways that trump points out as for the ideological battle is china better or western enlightenment with freedom i can not believe such a topic is even considered which sadly it is too often first of all if getting rich is so important and you are willing to subjugate yourself to a police state and dictatorship then be my guest but if you want to get rich and be free guess what the us is the richest country in the world every country that has adopted enlightenment values is also rich and free and flourishing china got rich by stealing technology stealing industry utilizing slave labor destroying its environment and using its citizens like little pawns is that what you want compare china to hong kong same people different politics system people vote with their feet which side of the border has walls in addition china can not get rich by stealing forever eventually they have to innovate but we can innovate better fuck their bootleg gucci and fake apple stores it is disgraceful to consider the chinese ideology a good one for the human race,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

i will try to make it short the so called refugees were nepalese who fled nepal due to the political instability occurring in the country at the time or simply wanted to move to another nation bhutan india so on when they arrived in bhutan they were allowed to do so provided they abide by the local laws traditions however the geo political climate at the time saw many tibetanburman kingdoms falling to either india ladakh sikkim or to china tibet sikkim in particular is an important case as the royal families of sikkim bhutan are cousins as part of indias strategy to annex sikkim a large percentage of nepalese indians who having settled in the country removed the chogyal of sikkim the royal family from power the native sikkimese were reduced to becoming a minority in their own nation bhutan having witnessed this refused to suffer the same fate the royal govt of bhutan came up with the plan to unify its people so that no foreign agent could ever topple bhutan unfortunately the nepalese did not see that way despite being reassured that it would not take away their cultural heritage or identity some possibly more of the nepalese incited doubt fear among their countrymen which resulted in nepalese asking for a new land within bhutan just as bhutan feared any nepalese who refused to go along with this madness were deemed as traitors by other nepalese killed or harmed while it is true that bhutan did resort to using armed forces to quell the problem this was only done after failing to come to a peaceful solution with the nepalese there were strict orders to not harm the nepalese after all some of them held high posts in royal govt when all else failed majority of the nepalese decided not expelled to get out of bhutan despite pleas from the nation not to do so those who remained became the current lhotshampas while it is true that bhutan could have handled things in a better way the nepalese gave little choice to for a proper solution these refugees like telling outsiders their sob story but they always conveniently omitt having their hand in causing their own problems or the real reason of leaving bhutan the lhotshampas living in bhutan are given equal opportunity treatment as any other bhutanese ethnic group and for those wondering lhotshampas is the correct political term for bhutanese citizens of nepalese heritage the so called refugees are nepalese plain simple being able to speak dzongkha does not make you a bhutanese otherwise anyone who can speak japanese or english is automatically by that logic a british or a japanese citizen,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

are you really comparing a practice that happened hundreds of years ago to present day and even if year olds could get married nowadays the taliban is forcing them to get married which is completely haram and can constitute as rape you are quite literally a pedophile and an absolutely disgusting and sorry excuse of a human beingno mate women are not property you can not take them especially if its against their will that plus this is not a war in the islamic sense the taliban murder innocent people and allah says those who murder are not one of us in war you are not even allowed to burn trees let alone murder innocent men women and children this is not the real islam this is not islam period,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

i personally believe that humans are naturally mostly good however hierarchy has a lot of inherent issues though in some situations of intense competition where efficiency is key it can be useful but ultimately hierarchy is problematic in that you are reliant on the hope that those in power are competent and have interests that align with those that are not in power sometimes this is true but if people that do not fullfill these criteria reach positions of power they can create a cycle where they create people that can not be trusted with power but that want power this is why in the long term hierarchy should be avoided it is not a complete dichotomy either but there is something to be said for the bare minimum of hierarchy as the ideal state of man,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

on a side note i believe i have seen at least some versions of it it essentially defends capitialism to develop to get to a stage so communism is viable yes this is a strategy similar to the ussrs nep but conducted on a longer and more total scale it is based in marx and engels writings on a historical materialist and economic determinist progression of human history i have some writings on this that you may find interesting i will copy the comment below in a moment orthodox marxism and china orthodox marxists and some mls marxismleninism is after all derived from orthodox marxism hold a view of marxs economic determinism and historical materialism where the capitalist mode of production performs a necessary historic role the capitalist mode of production is necessary to break the feudalistic mode of production to turn petty industry into the foundry the factory and the power plant individual production into petty socialized production individual labor being no longer sufficient for the production of goods production is now pursued as a social effort of many people in coordination and production is no longer done for subsistence but instead produces excess intended for distribution and trade to the whole of society the capitalist mode of production is both a socializing production that introduces class antagonisms and a stochastic process of progressive economic upheaval from feudalistic productive relations before capitalist production ie in the middle ages the system of petty industry obtained generally based upon the private property of the laborers in their means of production in the country the agriculture of the small peasant freeman or serf in the towns the handicrafts organized in guilds the instruments of labor land agricultural implements the workshop the tool were the instruments of labor of single individuals adapted for the use of one worker and therefore of necessity small dwarfish circumscribed but for this very reason they belonged as a rule to the producer himself to concentrate these scattered limited means of production to enlarge them to turn them into the powerful levers of production of the present day this was precisely the historic role of capitalist production and of its upholder the bourgeoisie engels socialism utopian and scientific this section of the text is a synopsis of the fourth section of capital the historic role of capitalist production is such that socialism can only be built from the capitalist society it originated from socialism requires capital to have been enlarged to the point of forming and requiring socialized production to function china is pursuing a socially directed capitalist development capitalism run by a revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat only time can tell if they will be able or willing to make the revolutionary departure from a developed capitalist society to an economically developed nation in the lower stages of a socialist society china had to move from a colonized feudalistic society broken apart into separate territories run by foreign nations and domestic warlordism into a world power even now chinas productive forces are behind that of other developed nations where it is the most populous country on earth yet runs an economy that is comparable to that of a population less than a quarter of its own in this manner they have to some degree argued that a limited national bourgeoise you can even see the origination of this strategy in on the question of the national bourgeoisie mao zedonghttpswwwmarxistsorgreferencearchivemaoselectedworksvolumemswvhtm serves a similarly counterimperialist economic function as nationalism serves as a social function in the struggle for material liberation from a colonized society the chinese system is not incompatible with marxism nor does it refute or reject it instead it has embraced an approach of stagism after all it is marx who viewed full maturation of capitalism as the precondition for socialist realization eighth national congress of the communist party of chinahttpswwwmarxistsorgsubjectchinadocumentscpcthcongresshtm this report talks about a necessary and complicated alliance with the national bourgeoisie against foreign imperial forces and the class struggle and restrictions that will take place against the bourgeoisie as they attempt to further implement capitalism the cpc at this time wanted to implement state capitalism similar to the ussrs new economic policy in order to gain the support of the national bourgeoisie and make use of them economically while enforcing state control over private industry and simultaneously persuading and reeducating them throughout the gradual transition to socialism the report also covers the want for implementing peaceful international relations with every country including the usa and the need to be vigilant in the face of imperialist hostility while doing so peaceful rise type stuff the congress argues for this because they recognize the primary contradiction within postrevolution china as the condition of the country backwards productive forces vs the peoples increasing material and cultural needs deng was not making things up out of nowhere when he referenced the same things to advance reform these were party thoughts under mao the difference is that mao moved beyond them the congress predicted it would take three year plans or a little longer to industrialize and one or two year plans to transition to socialism indeed under mao enormous strides were made in transforming the country from its wartorn state into an industrialized egalitarian socialist powerhouse here lies the break overlypragmatic deng and other roaders did not think that china had made enough use of the capitalists yet because everyone was equally poor and further benefits could be squeezed out of a capitalistalliance before transitioning to socialism undoubtedly there was an external influence from other countries including the asian tigers such as lee kuan yew mao obviously disagreed and launched the gpcr to root out and stop revisionists like deng but to his disappointment more workers defended their superiors than did bombard them and broadly speaking the gpcr did not accomplish its goals third plenary session of the eleventh central committeehttpwwwbjreviewcomnationtxtcontenthtm here this report on a plenary session taking place soon after maos death returns to the conclusions made by the th national congress to shift the emphasis back to socialist modernization and generally advocating for a more practicebased approach for developing under changing historical conditions clearly from the th national congress we can see that dengs reforms were not new or unique ideas but built upon a strategy first discussed under mao,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

dude i am russian and i can smell propaganda and bs from miles away because russia was an expert in propaganda and loved to engage in it as someone actually russian unlike you i have learned to recognize how propaganda works because americans or people who buy into american soft power think they are democratic and their mediagovernment respects human rights whatever that means a view still surprisingly held by surprisingly many people they have difficulty seeing american propaganda in respect to other countries for example the narrative on russia has recently shifted rapidly from people viewing russia as an adversary to more of a friend expect to see the allegations of russian cheating in the olympics to be withdrawn or toned down in the coming months and china from going neutral to enemy from what i can see america is currently upping antichinese rhetoric as it has done with russiaussr on numerous occassions to distract from its failures to handle the coronavirus epidemic despite having months of forewarning especially going into election season furthermore you are buying into american soft power by using their own terms what do you mean you may ask what i mean is that the terms you use freedom of speech democracy etc are all political slogans that where frequently used in the ussr and continue to be used in russia these slogans are meant to instill a certain point of view but they work particularly well in america because it sells the view of free and fair unbiased media however this is far from the truth i suggest you read manufactering consent by noam chomsky i can link you a free version of it if you lack money to purchase it as it explains in depth how the american propaganda method works it also seems that despite the ccps faults they are mostly truthful why because they view themselves as being in an inferior position and because they know they lack soft power so if they were caught in lies would mean reputational damage the us also understands this and that is why it tries to blow things out of proportion and damage chinas reputation,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

it is whataboutism and not even a good one china is performing genocide now is not countered by america performed genocide in the past every country on earth has skeletons literally in their closet that does not mean we should not try to be better now as far as migrant camps go first as horrible as they were they are not even close to the same in terms of treatment or number of people second half the country was absolutely livid about those camps and the reports coming out of there and we removed the administration that was responsible for them third even though government in the states works slowly and there are a ton of messes to clean up and even though most of the new people who are being housed in the camps now are unattended minors andor people being quarantined due to covid rules and even though biden signed in his first week in office an executive order mandating s comprehensive review of the policies surrounding the campsa fair portion of the democratic voter base is still actively angry and advocating for more to be done to close those camps and make amends measurable progress is being made and that is still not enough for a lot of americans compare that to china where not only is no progress being made but most citizens are apparently supportive of the governments policies with regards to the uyghers they do not even recognize it as a problem to be solved so honestly how dare you try to compare these two incidents america is by no means perfect we have issues with police violence and discrimination all over but a big part of why those issues are so obvious is because we talk about them we have press that is free to report on them and we as citizens can vociferously attack our government for not doing better none of that is true in china the fact that the few leaks that are getting out paint the situation so badly means that if the government allowed free speech the way america does there would be no possible comparison between china and the migrant camps,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

bottom line this began when trump struck a deal with the taliban and was actually pushing to have all troops out at the end of last year i do not fault trump or biden the government of afghanistan and the leaders of their security forces were apparently so soft and orcorrupt they were unwilling to put up any resistance that could have permitted thousands of their fellow countrymen to leave was this an unmitigated disaster you betcha a bitter pill to swallow most definitely is we were supporting corrupt and incapable officials that were apparently unwillingunable to fight for their fellow countrymen i am furious just a few days of fighting could have saved thousands trying to leave we either should have left long ago or shitcanned the entire government and rebuilt it all from scratch,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

i think we are missing each other i am all for everyone who has experience with china doing a good job of reflecting their values and knowledge in how they vote and using that platform to express their outrage about the legitimate and numerous infractions that the ccp has committed and i think we also need to use our knowledge of china to educate people who have less interaction or knowledge about what goes on there and i am not trying to say that this should be a sub for chinese people obviously their own government has deliberately cut their own people off from having that platform and while i am always happy to engage with nonwumao mainlanders in the sub i recognize that it is not likely that they are going to come on here and talk about stuff from their own country as much as you and i might in a sub about america what i am trying to say is that i think it is unfortunately common that stuff devolves into a hate circlejerk here that i care about the good the bad and the ugly about china both because i want to be genuinely informed about all of those aspects in part because it affects my life as someone who lives in china and because i think it is important for the message that gets out to other people to be equally fair to me at least it damages the credibility of this sub at times with how negative the general bent of it is it would be a bit easier for me to believe some of the negative parts if i had the impression that people on this sub were interested in viewing china for everything it is good and bad,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

there is no way germany would go to war with both russia and france at once that is madness they would be throwing away decades of progress and prosperity said the world in the years before there is no way japan would attack the united states and try to conquer half the planet when they are already struggling to conquer china said everyone in the world before chinas strategic outlook is strikingly similar to that of germany before wwi and japan before wwii that of a power that has experienced a period of rapid growth that is suddenly faltering while the worlds other major powers slowly draw together in a coalition to oppose them an accelerating arms race with the worlds preeminent naval power even the dependency on foreign fuel and raw material imports all of these are serious war flags for an ambitious power like china we must also not forget that china is not a rational actor in the first place it is an autocratic oneparty state meaning the ccp cares nothing for the prosperity of china except insofar as it keeps them in power and would as soon squash it as build it if they felt it in their interest this is essentially what is happening under xi jinping already squashing the hightech sector under the guise of anticorruption is their means of reexerting party control back over the economy in the second place xi jinping himself is not a rational actor either by all accounts he is an insecure micromanager who isolates himself in paranoia and treats his ministers like an emperor rather than a normal boss a situation not conducive to receiving bad news or criticism indeed zero covid went on the way it did mostly because xi insisted personally that it should notably in his abrupt aboutface crackdown on shanghai last spring taken all together the risk of china doing something drastic like pearlharboring okinawa before their longsought strategic goals fly out of reach forever and japan and the us are fully ready to oppose them is far far higher than most people appreciate and to be clear the us and japan are dead serious about preventing an invasion of taiwan by force of arms this is not sabrerattling by politicians but the primary concern for military planners in both the us armed forces and jsdf moreover unlike in the cold war the threat of massive conventional response across the plains of europe is no longer there the only real risk being that of a limited and mostly naval war meaning all parties involved feel less risk involved in going to war while the economic interdependence that many people feel should make war less likely paradoxically make it more likely because it make the leaders of all nations involved feel insecure in ways that they would not were they more economically independent from one another as the two blocs of the cold war were,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

thank you for clarifying that we disagree on stuff but it is not personal i appreciate the objectivity but first you concentrate way to hard on the word geopolitic and i do not think this is a good thing because geopolitic is about balance and carefully weighting of interest and it legitimises every interest at play which is not really viable when dealing with the current china i mean do one consider china to be just another player with its own citizen to feed and economy to grow then it is questionable how much can be done on the line of you are either with us or against us since for everyone involved the objective is mainly to maximize profits and that can not normally happen by antagonizing any big economy but if you see china as an ideological enemy because of its increasing authoritarian tendency which i think one should there is the problem of what each side represents china is pushing hard for the legitimacy of an ethno state which unites it is people with nationalism and economic protectionism and their argument is that this model gets shit done i mean when the new headquarters of the african union is build by an chinese company it tends to impress people and you think trump can counter this push for nationalism and economic protectionism or does he rather legitimise this model of ideology which by the way the other economic center of the world besides china and the us really tries to fend off i am speaking of the eu sure the european countries also happens to have a surge in protectionist and nationalist parties but the consensus is to stick with the nonisolationist way but when trump is just slapping tarifs to protect its own economy instead of promote trade and cooperation the eu is forced to do more trade with china and the rest of the world this is what i mean most by blowing up the classic alliances nessecary to deter china i mean be honest do you really think thailand vietnam and cambodia are enough to contain china it is about economic interest and for that you guys will need the eu so what is it really ideological division or geopolitical powerplay,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

i agree it is horrible and inhumane and the wes i do not care attitude is incredibly cruel please keep us in the loop i have one more question though can an eventual agreement between the taliban and masosudrabbanijamiatis work if massud et al are not allowed to keep their militias the agreement will not have any value because once they are disarmed the taliban pakistan will take over their territoryon the other hand letting them keep their militias would scare the taliban isi because it would mean having a big force of motivated soldiers just km from kabul also i can not imagine atta mohamed or particularly dostum not trying to get their share of the pie and well another questionis ismail khan doing anything in iran or have the iranians have told him to stay quiet and do not mess with herat and well another questionis ismail khan doing anything in iran or have the iranians have told him to stay quiet and do not mess with herat i know these are many questions but i have been interested in afghanistan since i have quite a few friends from there and it is a country that i feel very close to my heart thanks a lot,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity
there is something to that but for all its power remember that the supreme court can not just get together and enact whatever new laws strike their fancy that day they can only rule on whatever cases make their way to their bench which is only a very tiny fraction of cases where the constitutionality of something congress the president a governor state or local legislature did is challenged and even then they do not generally have the power to tell them what to do usually it is just a question of whether something they did is consistent with the constitution if it is not they can repeal it but that is it they can say no guys cut that out but they can not tell them what to do also nominees have to be approved by the senate and the senate does reject many of those nominees or often makes it known in advance that they will reject them so their nominations are withdrawn so if it is an important presidential power it should also be remembered that it is limited in many ways both structurally and practically and also once they are on the court many nominees adopt judging philosophies very different than the kind that led presidents to nominate them david souter for example was a bush nominee who became a staunch consistent liberal harry blackmun likewise was a nixon nominee who wrote the roe v wade decision was not a thing those presidents could do about it because they are lifetime appointees no takebacks so yes it is a big deal it is important but probably not as important as people sometimes make it out to be especially when you consider that the vast majority of cases that supreme court hears have nothing to do with big partisan ideological questions but usually more finegrained technical issues that is why it is not uncommon to find cases where say clarence thomas rules on the same side as ruth bader ginsburg,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

we americans tend to glorify rome a lot due to our history of idolizing the virtues of classical antiquity and the europeans do it perhaps even more but we have got to remember that it was an evil empire through and through jewish rabbinical sources barely even use the word rome they called it the wicked kingdom the roman statesmen and armies did not hesitate to slaughter entire cities and even countries every step of roman expansion was over bloodsoaked ground and consolidated through brutality and far from bringing prosperity to the whole world the roman economic system was based on the foundation of slavery especially in the western roman empire even compared to rival empires such as sassanian persia the romans had a reputation for violence and oppression we should always keep this in mind when studying for considering roman history we can praise and appreciate the good parts but it requires a nuanced approach,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

not way off in my opinion however i personally believe that chinas financial and economic ambitions are the main threat that they pose not that they want to take over countries militarily more that they want to control the levers of financial and economic power given what i have seen and experienced regarding china and business this worries me greatly i think it would result in a level of corruption that exceeds what currently exists i also think it would broadly weaken what international law we currently have leading to further problems globally chinas lack of any real rule of law does not point to a country that should be leading others or be able to dominate others nothing is perfect and the us is certainly far from ideal but china would be a step in the wrong direction,761.1155555247003,infinity,infinity,infinity

because reddit is designed to appear as an open place to discuss ideas share moments etc and so by censoring key parts of what people want to say such as high rated posts it gives everyone a slightly distorted view of what everyone else is thinking it also makes some information harder to come by meaning fewer people are aware of what is happening i agree that reddit is not like weibo or something but it is concerning how all of our major tech companies are slowly but surely being bought out by chinese government interests here in canada our communications infrastructure is being threatened by huawei and backed by our own telus worldwide tiktok has become an incredibly popular social media platform despite working directly for the chinese government to censor information such as the million people in concentration camps just for their ethnicity tiktok has also censored people for being lgbtq disabled or fat but all of that is just fine with us i guess because it is one of the most downloaded apps in the world marvel the nba blizzard and more have all also jumped on the bandwagon what will our future look like when we excuse people in power trampling on the philosophy of freedom of expression on the justification of they are not government how will we even know what to fight for if we can not speak i guess apathy rules the world now,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

one example i can think of is watching or reading local news stories and noticing that the state media news loves to start drumming up antijapanese fervor about world war ii atrocitieshistory book disputes whenever there is a domestic issue that they would prefer to distract people from not to say that these are not worth being angry over but that they get brought up for political expedience for being a global superpower the prc has a real persecution complex and is constantly complaining about very hurt feelings due to other countries unfair and reckless actions but when you can read the original news for chinese audiences and can also understand international coverage of the same events you start to notice the prc bullshit spin that gets put on everything,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

you think i am blinded by antiimperialism and i think you are blinded by a profound academic and mathematical illiteracy you think i am not assessing the claims for what they are but you just do not understand what constitutes actual evidence the obvious bias of the author is just too much to handle it is baffling that anyone who is so clearly begging the question could be taken seriously that article is the most childish i have ever looked at computer models of a classroom with bars on it spooky thank you anonymous xinjiang informant official documentation repeatedly and unambiguously testifies to the fact that xinjiangs vtics engage in known and preexisting forms of coercive and abusive political reeducation but then the evidence is a term that does not have the same connotation in english but translates to wash brain that is what zenz defines as unambiguous there is nothing else there he repeatedly says how much evidence there is and then he does not produce any the chinese government claims that vtics are just like boarding schools and that its students can regularly ask for home leave however the author did not come across a single government document that outlines how vtics establish voluntary agreements with the students or how and within which parameters the latter can request leave this is academic research putting students in scare quotes and saying that they did not happen to find the policy on leave requests for students he says up to in uyghurs are interned do you know the massive amount of evidence that would fucking generate again the most ridiculous thing i have seen trying to pass as research,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

i tried to use your definition xb the cult of tradition the us has a literal cult regarding their constitution and founding fathers xb the rejection of modernism at the moment the culture in the us and most of the industrialized capitalist nations is full of postmodern thought post modernism is literally the rejection of modernist thought xb the cult of action for actions sake maybe i am not sure this would fit with the us but arguments for it would be the need to play world police it literally degenerated into some sort of crazy thing were the us just invades countries or uses the cia to killprop up governments around the world xb disagreement is treason look at fox news and stuff literally anyone who has a different idea of how the usa should be run is an american hating communist xb fear of difference the fear of the mexicans of the immigrants the fear of learning another language of the american supremacy ending xb appeal to a frustrated middle class both politcal partys appeal to the middle class bernie sanders tried to split up this party system with two identically parties but he lost xb obsession with a plot and the hypingup of an enemy threat this often combines an appeal to xenophobia with a fear of disloyalty and sabotage from marginalized groups living within the society such as the german elites fear of the s jewish populaces businesses and welldoings see also antisemitism xb you can see this happening with china as being the grand enemy overseas the mexican being it in the country xb pacifism is trafficking with the enemy because life is permanent warfare there must always be an enemy to fight xb there is a literal cult around war in the us and the us is in permanent wars around the world there is so many war movies everybody loves veterans and it literally has the biggest military budget around the world xb contempt for the weak there is almost no welfare in the us everybody needs to pull themself up their bootstraps i do not know about you but i would call this contempt of the weak in action xb everybody is educated to become a hero which leads to the embrace of a cult of death like i said before there is a very big culture around war in the us and a big honoring of soldiers just as an example in my country i am not from china we say that the military is full of peasants and drunks and its kind of funny to look at them so its in stark contrast to the us xb machismo which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere fascists thus hold both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits from chastity to homosexualitymachismo which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere fascists thus hold both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits from chastity to homosexuality xb i would not say this is a big thing in the us anymore xb selective populism i would say trump kind of represents it but otherwise i would not say that is a big thing in the us but maybe i do not know lmao xb newspeak i think the whole red scare was literally an attempt to denie the people to think for themselves also right now with the surveillance capitalism i would say it has the same effect even if the means are different,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

china had a child policy for decades on han chinese people whilst minorities like the uighurs were allowed genocide against han chinese what an absurd thing to say first why is it the role of the state to regulate how many times one can give birth that is a violation of human rights on a very fundamental level second the report cites the ccps own data saying that sterilizations of women in minority sections of xinjiang increased in just two years while they declined in the rest of china how is that not evidence of a deliberate effort to drive down the births of a particular minority which by the way meets the criteria of genocide under the uns genocide conventionhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigenocideconventiondefinitionofgenocide third it is clear that chinas birth rate has declined far more than the ccp had intended and now there is an effort to raise birth rates yet despite a concerted effort to raise the birth rate there is a drive to repress birth rates of particular minorities how does that square uyghurs numbers according to adrian zenz was gotten from the media erm you can read the full report herehttpsjamestownorgprogramsterilizationsiudsandmandatorybirthcontroltheccpscampaigntosuppressuyghurbirthratesinxinjiang it say quite clearly that the data on birth control and sterilization came from publicly available publications from local and national government institutions so if you think the data is wrong then you have beef with the ccp not zenz,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

that is kind of misleading the pla did very little fighting during wwii leaving the lions share to the kmt forces the kmt bled itself dry fighting the japanese the only thing the communists did in a positive sense was they agreed to stop fighting the kmt during that time and they would pull the occasional hit and run raid against japanese or collaborationist troops that is it so by the kmt was very much a spent force having spent years fighting the japanese almost exclusively meanwhile the ccp received massive funding from the soviets and after the soviets departed manchuria they invited the communists to take over there and gave them all the arms and equipment which had been abandoned by the japanese army of course there were plenty of other factors too as you mentioned the kmt had a huge corruption problem which was one of the reasons why the west gradually stopped funding them just as the soviets increased their funding and arming of the ccp but i do not think it was true that the kmt had superior weapons at least not after from that point they had access to both soviet and japanese weapons as for their respective levels of popularity i do not think we have any way of determining that because it is not like there was an election held or polling or anything we can stipulate that it is a reasonable guess that the ccp was popular in the countryside at least among people who received their propaganda about redistribution and promises of future wealth but they probably were deeply unpopular in the cities since the cities were taken not by popular revolts against the kmt but rather through siege warfare in which they were gradually starved into submission general peng dehui even bragged about that tactic claiming that he accomplished the same level of death and devastation as the hiroshima and nagasaki bombs over several months of siege warfare rather than with nuclear bombs so i can not imagine the communists were all that popular to the residents of those cities when they took them over,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

not really comparable we could talk about overcriminalization how overly invasive the war on drugs is or how the justice system allows the plea bargain system to be abused or how defendants should receive better legal representation all of those are real problems and though i would prefer to call it disparate impact i take it that this is what systemic racism is trying to capture but there is no moral equivalence between this and the cultural genocide of uyghurs keep in mind the uyghurs kept in the camps have not even been charged with crimes in chinas kangaroo courts even the prc government concedes they are innocent of any crimes at least in theory all inmates in the us have been given due process of law duly charged with specific crimes and are serving prison sentences as punishments for those crimes american prisons are no holiday but i have never heard even their staunchest critics allege that they attempt to brainwash inmates into loving the republican party and donald trump or that they try to deprive people of their culture or religious beliefs the american government does not have white people sent to live with black families in home stays to monitor their personal habits and religious practices they do not round up black children to be raised in government orphanages to be proper americans or separated from their churches it is actually kind of hard to find a direct on point parallel with american precedents the closest i could think of were the japanese internment camps during wwii and the schools set up for native american children during the turn of the century the former as horrifying as it was did not involve an attempt at cultural genocide japaneseamericans were not subject to tigerchairs sterilization or coerced into abandoning their culture or religion the native american experience is a bit closer but it was more about children than adults native american children were in many cases sent to orphanages and boarding schools where they were punished for speaking their native languages and coerced into learning english and practicing christianity but even this was done at a much smaller scale,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

the royals are very carefully about the image that they potray this is specially true for the king and the queen it is not that they need to hide their misdeeds they are quite just and as far as i know have not misused whatever power the constitution has given them but there is always the danger that their well intentioned deeds might be interpreted in some contorted manner by someone to suit their apocryphally rumors that they would like to perpetuate for whatever reasonsit is for this reason that they have to think through their actions quite thoroughly i myself have had the opportunity to attended a few royal audiences the king makes visits to schools and other educational institutions quite often and on analysing his speechs i find that not one word is uttered without thought for its possible implications and connotationsxd xd xd this leaves very little to criticize them over but ofcourse mistakes have been made in the past and there is a tendency to put the dust under the rug the official history that is taught in the schools could pass off as propaganda well this is true for almost all nations and i have a very bitter experience of working too hard on a presentation about the st king in which i may have referred a few of those banned books for a change of perspective on some issues only to be quite rudely rejected from presenting my work xd xd xd you could criticise the king but only in small circles but even then you would be thought of as being a sore prick by most people for not appreciating the royals this is especially true if you criticize the king but most people agree that a few of the royals are a bit of a douche fortunately they do not hold much power even within the family openly criticising the royals could lead you to prison for attempting to cause a civil unrest as i have explained above civil unrest is not favorable for our sovereignty xd xd there is an attempt to censor things that do not agree with the official version of certain issues but we do not have a thought police like the fbi or kgb or even if we do have one and i am unaware of their existence they are not very efficient as i could still search for some of these banned content without fear of being put on a blacklist you could even buy those banned books online and have them delivered to your home with the least amount of caution without any fear of being caught it is also possible to read them in public most bhutanese do not recognize these banned books so you will not even raise any eyebrows as long as you do not start a riot but it is a different story if you start making copies of the book and distributing that could be considered an attempt to cause civil unrest xd xd i have read a few of these banned books most are concerning the events of the s a few about the history of the royals some authored by foreign writers others by exiled refugees and each book has its own agenda and biases including the official version of events history is written by the winners after all and it is difficult to get a clear picture of what happened especially when all of these versions are so different with one another and make no attempt to consider the other versions had they done that it would have been easier to find those subjective biases and agendas,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

he is in china you are not allowed to espouse those opinions even as a foreign national sedition is illegal in china lebron working there means he had no choice but to take the official perspective i am in california i tell cops i smoke weed they shrug if i were in china and told cops i smoked weed back home in california they have the legal framework to test my hair for drugs and place me under arrest if i had told them exactly what they wanted to hear i would have got off scott free lebron gave the statement he did because to have gone against the ccp even as a foreign national is an act of sedition and is illegal in china lebron is not a traitor or a pro china shill he is trying to follow the law and not be arrested and tried in a bullshit court for bullshit charges there is doing the right thing in every instance which is true lawful and good then there is doing the questionable thing so that you can continue living such that you are able to do the right thing sorry about the caps i am angry that this circle jerk has turned into a full on train style gangbang because some guy who works for the ccp said something the ccp requires him to say wait until lebron gets back to america where there is freedom of speech sp that we can hear the real story,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity
dude same lol one of those throwback photos from a more innocent time i want to think the story goes like upon reaching s san francisco xi was given the american name dakota during his visit and got to see all of the sights he had grew up watching in his beloved banned hollywood films including his favorite lethal weapon the people there were warm towards him and this delighted him in hating the communist party of china the same party that disposed of his father years ago trying out hamburgers and jamming out to michael jackson and madonna for the first time he did not want to return to his home province but realized that he must return home to attempt ruling over the system that defines him yet confines him xi would develop a fondness for the country that he would work towards eventually losing against in the future during his trade war with american real estate tycoon and th president donald trump,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

now that is wrong and bordering on offensive it sounds like you are telling me that it is the way for china and chinese people to discriminate against foreigners or to be put more bluntly the chinese are xenophobic that is quite untrue as i said in all of my years living in shanghai travelling between china and america i know for a fact that most people are not xenophobic the reason why some are repulsive against the british and the japanese is due to the heavy emphasis on those two periods of history in china the britishs abuse destruction and robbery are extensively taught as well as the invasion of the japanese if you pick up a chinese literature textbook you are guaranteed to find a number of essays dedicated to the war heroes that is why some think that the japanese and the british are villains because that is how they have been portrayed that is a problem i agree because china should not be stuck in the past and the repulsion towards this generation of japanesebritish people is unjustified since they took no part in those invasions that being said i would like to emphasize again that you should not paint china or chinese people as xenophobic there is no racist organizations that get public attention in china no facist groups and no different religious groups who harm the other for believing in a different god yes discrimination does exist but i would actually say that it is much less frequent than it is in a country like america the enforcement against xenophobia in china is not as good hence why people can get away with trash talking japanese but the general population is not xenophobic as some people were led to believe,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

i get what you are saying i also do not think the term itself incites racist acts it is a descriptor i do think that the way we talk about things can have an impact on the way we think about them though i am an expat teaching and living in china graduated students living abroad have posted or spoken to me about troubles with landlords businesses and the general public they have felt like because they are chinese everyone thought they were carrying the disease the sad truth is that we are all a little bit racist the same has happened to foreigners in china once the only cases were imported however as the virus spread and was renamed these situations seemed to become less widespread my understanding is mostly anecdotal so i am also open to more evidence i do not think i believe calling it the chinese virus before it had another name was racist however novel coronavirus worked just fine for most i do think that it caused many people in the world to single out an ethnicity as health risks and that is where it became problematic i also think calling it the chinese virus after it was assigned the name covid is racist and i would argue that trump actually weaponizes the term for political gain having read a few comments from chinese redditors i also think it is important to point out the differences in opinions and experiences between chinese living in china and the chinese living elsewhere chinese in china may not face the same culture and identity struggles that chinese abroad do and are also unlikely to have experienced the same level of racism and perhaps are not as sensitive to it for example one of my chinese friends found the word chnk hilarious while my halfasian best friend in high school was called that word in the hallway one afternoon and cried for hours also i do not read mandarin and so i took the post at face value having read further comments from mandarin speakers i see that the post may have been misinterpreted my bad thanks for the discussion i love that reddit helps me challenge and interrogate my own understandings,719.5187103105683,82.26503489802836,7.260830486530938,1.7967151978244993

i actually do not think the us system was set up to create economic benefits for the us i tend to agree with the stratfor view that the bretton woods compact was set up as a bribe from the us to their allies in exchange for global opposition to the ussrglobal communism if the us was only interested in their own economic prosperity they would have operated as the british empire did and created a bunch of vassals and colonies that they would abuse economically to enrich the homeland but in terms of gdp growth basically all of the allies grew much more per capita than the us did after partly that is the natural result of the fact that basically all of the allies were devastated by the war and had way more room to grow compared to the us but it is also partly a strong indication that the us helped them grow wanted them to grow wanted the whole western world to be rich with the us not just to be under the uss thumb exploited by the us for the uss sole good you can ascribe selfish motivations to this like that the us needed these wealthy and reliable allies to contain the ussr and the us got more economic benefit from having some peer trading partners and not just colonies and vassals but personally i consider that more like searching for reasons to hate something you already hated than a rational and balanced look at the facts the facts are that the us had almost all the power in the world in and did what no other empire with that kind of power in history ever did before it helped allies grow wealthy and powerfuleven the allies that were its mortal enemies in ww and it bore the brunt of the military security costs in both blood and treasure to ensure that mutual prosperity the ussr was far more authoritarian and exploitative of the countries under its sphere of influence actually treating them as vassals and colonies and the ccp just straight up violently annexed as much as they possibly could in xinjiang inner mongolia and especially tibet whether you think the us play was benevolent generosity or simply more clever machiavellianism we should cheer for a world where great powers try to secure that power with generosity towards allies rather than subduing them militarily and then exploiting them economically creating vassals colonies or outright annexing territory in both the us and the ussr had the power to make a choice about how they would treat the countries that had come under their spheres of influence the us choice proved to be more stable more sustainable so more clever perhaps but also it proved to create a far better quality of life for the people in allied countries and that is something we should all want,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

my general impression from stories that have come out in the meantime is that the deal was a sham and trump never actually intended to leave he was going to continue to have troops stationed in the country and attempt some sort of forced reconciliation between the taliban and the afghan government with the deal merely being a way to start the process not saying this was the most brilliant plan in the world or if its even true but if it is true it means biden mostly followed through on a deal was never supposed to be followed through on and really trumps pattern of endlessly lying and then covering updistracting from the lies with even more lies fits this explanation,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity
from my conversation with cubans in cuba the government is not repressive at alli grew up in south florida and i have worked to get medicine into the country cubans say one thing in the country but something totally different when they are not being spied oni know people who were ideologically devoted communists people who fought in the revolution people who backed castro and i do not know anyone who supports the current government i also know a ton of right wing folks who are not to be trusted on cubaand i can tell you that people when they are in cuba they are generally afraid of being spied onim not interested in an argument about that but the cuban government is so hugely corrupt that it does not even have the support of people who are left or leftish and that has to do with the dual currency system and a bunch of other decisions that have to do with them just being authoritarian and repressiveyou got to see things in context in comparison to what would have been they have been relatively unopposed in taking powerbecause the government betrayed the people and ordered the army to stand downtheir takeover is not done yet the ana and commandos are regrouping in panjshirper aljazeera talibs have ruled out an inclusive democracy and so they have chosen civil warafghanistan will either be inclusive or there will be civil war there are no other optionsso the taliban is choosing war thus it can not be called a peaceful takeover there is no what would have been there is only what isand what is is the taliban refusing to engage peacefully which means that the year long civil war will only continue because a plurality of afghans will never submit to the will of others imposed by violenceyou are assuming that there is an option for the taliban to moderate and maintain controlthis was never an option,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

i would not say i am pro ccp or anti ccp but i do have to admit that considering that taiwan is a democratic country democracy in such a big country such as china poses massive issues and problems for starters china is a country with many many ethnic minorities some of whom are very culturally different from han people having some form of unity among all citizens of china will require immense effort and dedication having a democracy will slow this down additionally whether you like to admit it or not democracy can be divisive the last thing china needs right now is internal division if the people of the country are not united and unified the country is bound to fail moving on from that having different parties who have different priorities and goals will not make the lives of chinese people better it is quite unproductive to have a party come into power and make a set of policies only for the policies to be reversed when the next part comes into power i do believe that some form of democracy can work but certainly not western democracy with the one man one vote ideology,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

the way to tell ccp trolls is to look at the grammatical structure of what they are saying chinese is a very specific and interesting language with a very specific set of grammatical structures people who are not fluent fully in english will transport their chinese grammar as will anyone speaking a language they are not fully fluent in not a shots fired moment but with chinese it is pretty obvious especially when they are trying to tie it in combination with a negative view about america that does not fully make sense like they will get the facts wrong about the structure of us society and government because they do not know what they are talking about as will many people not just ccp trolls they may confuse the wrong party or they think the supreme court is the court that will head a trivial case they might say something boneheaded about the way our elections work that is just so obviously wrong you have to laugh but they are almost always wrong in a way that only seems obvious to an american they will try to sound smart but the combination of grammar that reads like a soviet poster and the insults aimed at things that do not really make sense or are wrong headed is a dead giveaway if you look at a comment and it just seems off and you think it is a ccp propagandist call them that and watch them implode talk about tsq massacre or the tibetan genocide tell them you support hk democracy now and watch them implode into insults about how china will overtake the world and it is the end of america i enjoy doing that when i am bored i hope this made any sense i am not trying to be offensive to people who are not fully fluent but if what i am saying makes sense to you just look out for it you will see,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

if you think they are experts you should see the people of this valley most of the taliban originate from the south where there are far less mountains these are the people of the hindu kush they fought the soviets in the same manner once the soviets would enter the valley they would retreat up the mountainside and wait for the inevitable soviet departure when that happened they would swarm the bases of afghan soldiers that were left behind to garrison and make their life living hell the only footholds the soviets ever got in this valley was due to helicopter insertions and even then they were very temporary at best,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

ok then i apologise for my mistake my bad and yes you are definetly right about this but to me it does not seem as if people are overshadowing or dismissing the suffering of children and men to me it seems as if the general perception is that afghans in general suffer alot its just that currently people focus on womens rights which makes sense i mean during their former rule women had little rights and that is to be expected to repeat during this rule all regular afghans suffer alot but focusing on one group in particular due to recent events does not mean that the others get dismissed or overshadowed forever or throughout an unaccaptable amount of timeim open for a discussion if i said something wrong again then feel free to correct me,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

they respect women by their own fundamentalist perspective of women which is like saying that slave owners care for their slaves and are helping them become civilized which was a justification for slavery for hundreds of yearsim not sure what you are trying to do here but you can make the accurate claim that the taliban is better than is without believing fundamentalist drivel about how its respectful to enslave half the population striping all autonomy and choice away from women to lead their own lives and putting that power entirely in the hands of their male relatives is not respecteta i want to be fair here to you because you are making a larger point which is true if the peoples of afghanistan had autonomy over the various regions of their country in the last several decades they would have created a society that did not resemble western nation state nor western gender relations and yes through its own logic would have been far more respectful of women than what they have now even though it would look strange from a western perspective the idea that all women in the world or men for that matter wish to go out and blaze their own path and seek their individual fortunes is a very western ideabut if you have honestly convinced yourself that the taliban is offering a version of that then you have been brainwashed the taliban comes out of about years of imported salafism then a decade of interference with other countries followed by two decades of us occupation it is pure rigid fundamentalism and not of afghan origin there is nothing respectful to women about it and if you are painting a rosey picture of it in your head i highly recommend you depropagandize yourself and make some really reflections on how selfserving it is for you to believe that its better for women and girls for them to be entirely under the control of their male guardians from cradle to grave,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

i do not think i brought the us into the mix and the us is not the only country dropping bombs ethnic tensions in xinjiang can be traced back for many centuries but it seemed that extremist attacks only started to pop up fairly recently all of this should be examined in a global context it seemed that religious extremism fueled terrorist activities happen regardless of how the religion is treated locally these attacks happen in europe where all religions and beliefs are respected they happen in the middle east were different sects of the same religion bomb the hell out of each other they happen in africa where the local government is not strong enough to battle local insurgents i could go on but you get my point at a certain point a line needs to be drawn and people needs to realize that religious extremism is the real issue all these attacks i mentioned occurred before the implementation of many of the controversial measures and i do hope that you are not justifying these atrocities as legitime responses to long running ethnic tensions,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

the reasons keep changing one day its for women rights one day its due to and because the region is a terrorist hub bla bla biden denies he went there for nation buildinghuh we entered afghanistan in under bush like biden said in the article you posted we went there to get bin laden and wipe out alqaeda how do the reasons for the initial invasion keep changingxball i am saying is we are at square and even worse off because the us did not achieve any of its ever changing goalsyeah i do not think anyone disagrees with you on that we can lay waste to conventional armies but not so great at what comes afterxblet me pose a scenario to you does it make sense to go to war with germany in kill hitler and then withdraw and let the nazi regime continue its terrors of course not it was waged to oppose the taliban al qaeda ideologies and the threat emanating from thegermany did not have an active and wellorganized insurgency constantly fighting us for years if it did i would not be surprised if we withdrew from germany also we did not go to war with germany because of the holocaust or nazi war crimes details about the holocaust did not even come out until near the end there was plenty of progermany support in the us if japan had not directly attacked the us and germany slowed its aggression i doubt we would have entered the war at all,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

it does not matter what i did with my life people living there are facing their day of reckoning what they choose to do now will define their society for the next few decadesthere are a few facets of human experience that are common facing difficult situations is one of them anyone who has been through a situation that is even moderately stressful has an inkling of how difficult it could be but anyone who has been through any kind of hardship also knows that at the end of the day all that matters is what you choose to do you may be overwhelmed by everything around you you may beg for help bawl your eyeballs out but the only thing that will matter at the end would be the choice that you made and the action that you took you can have friends next to you at that moment but you are the one who will have to make the journey if this is something you have not experienced in your life then i am sincerely happy for you but the people in afghanistan are facing an extreme version of what i described above even if they make the right choice in this situation it may end up resulting in their death but this fight will define the lives of the next few generations so if they believe that the life without taliban rule for their children is worth fighting for they have to take up arms now and there is no one else that will be able to fight this fight for themyoure right when you imply that i do not get the difficulty they find themselves in but it will not matter the fight that they have to fight has nothing to do with me or you it is a fiercely personal choice and sadly they are at a stage in their lives where they are facing this choice it will define the next few years of their countrys historyyou and i have better lives than what could have been because people like us in the earlier generations made that difficult choice and made unimaginable sacrifices people in afghanistan face the same situation todayit is a place of naiveity undisturbed by an experience of fear of survival that motivates your question,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

there is nothing wrong with chinese people the problem is the chinese government hong kong and taiwan may have superiority complexes but they are ultimately just chinese people who through twists of fate have avoided the tyranny of the communist party they are not intrinsically better than mainlanders any moreso than west germans are better than east germans however while they may not be perfect as a society it is undeniable that they have taken a better and gentler path and when they see mainlanders who in many cases are unquestioning believers in whatever the communist party tells them to believe many of whom believe that violence is an acceptable reaction to any political disagreements many of whom wish to destroy the societies they have built to bring them into the fold of an incredibly authoritarian regime where they would likely be put under martial law and reeducated or worse many of whom the chinese government use as spies can you honestly blame them for feeling the way they do about mainlanders it may not always be a fair generalization but it is not one that is without reasons as for a peaceful coexistence the best way to do that honestly is to let them seceed and focus on rebuilding trust ethnic groups that feel trapped by far more powerful ethnic groups tend to turn towards violence and sometimes even terrorism i feel like a broken record by constantly bringing up ireland and the united kingdom but there are many lessons that can be learned from it in ireland was annexed into the united kingdom beginning a rather dark chapter in its history ireland has fewer people today than years ago let the implications of that sink in during world war a group of irish rebels captured the city of dublin and demanded independence for ireland the uprising failed the rebel leaders were executed ireland rose up in rebellion causing a civil war in the united kingdom ultimately of irelands counties broke free from the united kingdom the remaining counties had more british people than the rest but still had a lot of irish people the republic of ireland and the uk have been at peace since it broke away and have generally tried to move on from their viscious past while the counties that stayed in the united kingdom were the host of a nasty civil war where both the irish and the british were actively committing acts of terrorism against each other there were assassinations massacres bombings families slaughtered in the night the british population of the republic of ireland was assimilated peacefully to the point where the distinction is now meaningless irish people in britain are treated well yet the british and irish populations of northern ireland are vicious enemies because many in the irish group want to leave the empire that dominated them for centuries sometimes it is better to just let it go and try to work with a cleaner slate as long as a subset of a society sees you as an occupying force they will never stop being restless they will never forget past injustices they will never stop remembering every slight it needs to no longer be relevant or looming for people to truly move on if they are still at chinas mercy then even if china is on its best behavior how will they know china will not someday regress and commit new atrocities,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

uhh the list is not from me i am just using it because it came from a profession who probably knows a lot more political theory then i do and the reason why phrases like western enlightened views sounds to altright is because neonaziism is an extension or logical conclusion if you will of the altright i do not believe the ccp has value for liberty and if they do they do not demonstrate it through their politics as far as i am concerned but values like such are not openly rejected in their preachings to the public which do not get me wrong is obviously a victim we can keep talking about the conception of modernism postmodernism and neotraditionalism if you would like and there is certainly a point to be made there and i have a little bit of knowledge regarding the subject xb i would like to concede as i have changed my mind i did not think this through when i first commented but the ccp clearly appeal to the middle class via spreading this idea of the ideal middle class being nationalist and as a leftist any nationalist positivity is harmful and should be opposed xb oh by the way would you mind me asking your political standing just curious,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

i suppose they end to skip over that part in a lot of the holocaust films but i think it was significant that they did not so much in schindlers list there is this exchange right toward the end where this russian soldier is all like you have been liberated in the name of the soviet red army and he sounds kind of foolish since schindler already talked all the nazi guards into leaving and returning to their homes so that the remaining jews were already liberated but one of them ben kingsley i think asks okay so where do we go now and the russian soldier does not quite know at first he has a moment of humanity and empathy and warns them not to go east they hate you guys out there but he finally directs them to a village in the other direction the schindler jews start walking in that direction only for the picture to fade into the real life schindler jews in israel where they are leaving stones on the grave of oskar schindler so they did not come right out and say that things were still rough for the survivors in but it was an interesting moment i believe originally i was under the impression that as soon as the camps were liberated everything was okay that the american british free french and soviet armies took care of them and they all got to go back home oh my sweet summer child,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

i am an attorney who represents siv clients special immigrant visa which you can get if you assisted the united states we have been complaining for years that the siv approval process is way too slow anyways the pro bono organization my law firm partnered with had started talks about evacuating at least two months ago both people with siv approval and those whose applications were still pending since approval takes forever but we were told the situation would be stable for a few more months and so it never really got off the ground now obviously its chaos most of our clients are not in kabul and have no safe way to get to kabul or any other way out of their townvillage they are sheltering in place at least we hope we lost touch with several clients in the last few days for those in kabul we are trying to arrange transport out as you have seen in the news a lot of siv holders made it to fort lee va for those with siv applications still pending who do not yet qualify for a visa to the us we are trying to set up a temporary facility in qatar where people can wait safely but who knows what will happen it absolutely breaks my heart knowing many of our clients are probably already deadedit as you have probably seen in the news the us will try and bring siv applicants to the us unclear what that means or how they will accomplish it no plans at the moment for many of these applicants who do not live in or near kabul and have no way of getting to the kabul airport,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity
you seem to be very passionate about this topic for some reason because i lived there for five years i made many local friends i listened to their perspectives i empathized with their fears and hardships all we know from this video is that the uyghur girl is not allowed to speak other languages in school because it is a mandarin school and she does not have any other alternative there are no more true uyghur schools just nominal bilingual schools that restrict minority languages to a very small part of the curriculum in which speaking uyghur outside of those select classes is still not allowed there used to be many successful uyghurrun private language training schools but as far as i am aware most if not all of them have been shut down who cares what she speaks outside of school obviously she can speak uyghur with her parents she could also be immersed with uyghur on the streets in supermakets on the tv etc but she will not speak it with people her age as she and the rest of her cohorts are already being conditioned against it i already see it large groups of kids all uyghur or all kazakh but all speaking together in mandarin because the conditioning they recieve in school does not end when the bell rings i do not know what your background is but what you said does hit home a little since i am chinesecanadian and i can tell you the people around me only speak english they do not really care about keeping their heritage language because let us face it why should they they grew up in an english speaking environment and they communicate and work in english if you want to preserve your heritage language you are able to there are chinese language training schools popping up all over the place and nobody restricts them you have china taiwan singapore and many overseas communities that speak your language it is in no risk of dying out still canada is an immigrant country aside from the of indigenous people whose cultures and languages have already been dealt a great deal of damage from colonialism and that horribly misguided boarding school policy canadians are mostly immigrants or descendants of immigrants they chose to move there uyghurs did not choose to live in a mandarindominant country they only have one homeland one bastion of their culture their situation is not the same as yours people strive for a good life so they would ditch their own language for a language that is more useful this unfortunately is an effect of globalization and a developing society imagine if you were a uyghur parent would you want your child to have a life with less opportunities by sending her to a uyghur school or would you send her to a han school the uyghurs i know all want to preserve their cultural identity you seem to believe what is going on is by the uyghurs own will rather than something being forced upon them the douyin page seems normal too does not look like a ccp propaganda page just some year old girls teachers profile and that is the scary part that video is deleted for some reason though apparently she got a lot of backlash she does not have many followers all she needed was backlash from one chain of higherups seeking to delete something that sheds a negative light on what they are doing but you are reading too much into one video no the video goes handinhand with my own experiences there is a lot of misinformation about the plight of the uyghurs a lot of videos that have nothing to do with the uyghurs being mislabelled as misrepresented as evidence of the uyghur situation which actually just serve to discredit all allegations by those with a proccp bias then you will have videos like this impossible to deny and the same people arguing that china works hard to promote uyghur culture and language have suddenly changed their tune claiming that the erasure of uyghur language and culture is justifiable in the name of ethnic unity which only serves to confirm the same fears they were denying a week before before there was a question of whether or not cultural genocide was real or not now the conversation has shifted to the extremes of whether the cultural genocide is good or evil,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

there is sometimes a thing that christians do where they try to define who is and who is not a real christian i remember in high school some of the evangelical kids would ask people are you a christian or are you a catholic and mormons could tell you quite a bit about how other christians often define them out of being christian i find that it often depends on how well regarded the group is if it is a group of people we like even if they are not our sect they are christian but if they are weird or do awful things then they are not real christians just like the whole no true scotsman problem that all being said certainly the taiping folks were at best highly heterodox christians i would say that there were certainly some christian beliefs that their sect incorporated but they were too idiosyncratic to be simply described as christians i mean if you are going around claiming to be the literal brother of jesus well that is not going to work for christianity if we understand xtianity to describe jesus as the one and only son of god one needs a description of christianity that does not just mean belief in the divinity of jesus because by that standard muslims and bahai would also count as christians,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

sad but i can not blame them its a few hundred men congested in a valley with limited firearms everything is against them at the moment yes one might hope that a population that has experienced some degree of education and freedom over the past years will not just roll over to the taliban and in that case its wise to establish a small pocket of resistance in case that hits critical mass already there are protests in major cities and fighters took back some cities in baghlan also dostum and atta have not been heard from since mazar fell and they will make or break any resistance atta sent his son to the jamiat negotiations dostum very distinctly did not of course this is all wishful thinking on my part the deck is very much stacked against the panjshiris hence the negotiations but everything in afg politics is temporary and if they reach a deal its only for now what would an inclusive government mean for the taliban anywaymillion dollar question to the negotiators it will mean representation and therefore protection for ethnic minorities to the taliban it will mean horseshit,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

not getting ratings is one factor to why this happens but logistics is an even bigger one journalists from any country very rarely cover a conflict that their own country does not have a presence in because its more difficult and expensive to get the information to report on along with being far more dangerous when you can not be airlifted out by your own military as is very common for war correspondents and though it can be hard to believe sometimes most media has pretty high standards of reporting on conflicts and pretty much do not write or show something they can not verify firsthand which means if they can not get boots on the ground they will not cover it that the countries with these conflicts rarely have a significant established journalism presence of their own plays a big role too otherwise their reporting could be used abroad but not a whole lot exists in the more rural afghan provinces or in yemen as you mention,758.5982773679641,infinity,infinity,infinity

taiwan is not independent it is still being colonised by china but it is fighting for its freedom i think it is crucial to recognise the fact that the republic of china in taiwan is not actually an independent taiwanese government in fact it is an exiled chinese government which has colonised taiwan originally the republic of china was almost synonymous with the kuomintang chinese nationalists however nowadays it is true that the native taiwanese have infiltrated the ranks of the republic of china and are now sort of governing themselves they are still fighting against the chinese institutions which have been established in their country but at least nowadays they have the capacity to fight at all in the past they had no power whatsoever the taiwanese have been fighting against the republic of china and the kuomintang through democratic processes rather than violence i think the law which was passed to legalise samesex marriage should be considered taiwanese though because it was the independenceoriented democratic progressive party which passed the bill rather than the kuomintang colonisers the kuomintang was actually the main force in taiwan which was opposed to the passing of the bill around seven kuomintang legislators refused to tout the party line and decided to vote in favour of samesex marriage these people are now being expelled from the kuomintang despite the fact that the kuomintang never indicated that it would do this if they did not support the party line the kuomintang is the main political party within taiwan which believes that taiwan belongs to china the chinese communist party has no official presence within taiwan,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity

you have said two wrongs do not make a right multiple times if two wrongs do not make a right why are you belittling someone for speaking about themselves you are doing what you say is so wrong this once again is not a straw man argument i am drawing upon many things you have already said that attack this persons character as i said this is a straw man you have come across as sexist by out right defending women about intentionally changing their outward appearance for social gains and saying any man who inflates their earning in conversation is a bad person what is the worst outcome from either scenario without extenuating factors all i see is someone having a bruised ego at the end of the day even if i do believe it is hogwash it is not an argument i am going to dive into again because it does not justify the original position that said inferring a position is not the same as outright defending women about intentionally changing their outward appearance for social gains and saying any man who inflates their earning in conversation is a bad person because i have not outright defended that and i am not going to,infinity,infinity,infinity,infinity
