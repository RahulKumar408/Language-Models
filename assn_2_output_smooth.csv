go ask any muslim in pakistan and some parts of middle east they say taliban are talib students of what islam and they are freedom fighters also they are not misinterpretatibg quran quran itself is an ourdated book written by various people that would be called misinterpretation because mohammad was illiterate so he could not write who knows what his follwers wrote what mohammad said what taliban is following is the closest to th century lifestyle and set of laws written by men for men about both men and women pretty sure no opinion of any women was included during the writing of those rules ypu call sharia also have you ever wondered that if islam is being misinterpreted then how come no muslim nation or community follows the true islam because guess what the more secularismfreedom of worshipping for non believers under islamic rule espically idolatry freedom of expressionwomen and gay rights etc the nation is the more it misinterpretes quran and dosent allow the raw teachings of quran to be regarded as a state or nations law because all the things in mentioned above are not included in quran and its kind of opposite in sharia the dimmis and kaafirs have clearly the lowest form of treatment and muslim women are just above that and at the top are all muslim scholars and mujahids just like how mohammad wanted to have this lifestyle forever,1285.8524814054624,5914.328198325539,25528.824816510132,31214.405087112416

because talibans are now fighting the other way around than they are used to if possibly there k talibans in baghaln then of course they are not all packed together making easier targets but if we say there is k together that are trying to flee and retake the salang pass then they will be harassed and ambushed multiple times on the way to salang by guerilla fighters probably losing a bunch of fighters and vehicles so at the time they get to salang they might have lost hundreds of fighters remember their vehicles are unarmored and they have very little experiences against hit and runs they will retake the salang pass and run but after that it means no more force in the north and the na will retake it easily if the forces stay they will try to fight but without local support and the locals taking up arms they will be ambushed and killed as they travel so its not a very good prospect for the tb right now without a reinforcementlogistics line the only advantage tb has right now are nvg but all the other technologies are useless and will not outweigh the match against the resistanceedit but that means they already had the time to equip their force with it and have enough competent fighters to use nvg which i do not think they had time for now,824.8242348814761,3355.087507309577,17821.381770970464,28048.536670358106

actually that information is outdated the testing kits were not used properly and you can find the official statement if you look it up hence why the media stopped talking about the testing kits some of the masks are faulty but that is simply because of the fact that china suddenly has to provide the supplies to a lot of the countries let us be honest if china did not get them out in time they would face criticism anyways if people are so eager to blow things out of proportion xb but yeah glad to see that rchina is still the good old anti china community as it was,616.1152926413847,1995.274223974034,11838.647985447906,21528.14966062004

to be honest i do not find anything wrong with what she said even chinese children living in places like the uk or us can be ashamed of their chinese names however given the political situation in xinjiang most uighur children are usually very hesitant to disclose too much about their families even to teachers why the ccp employs a tried and old method of be friending children to find out any secrets a family might have it might seem all fun and games but its going to go into their notes i might sound paranoid but this is xinjiang we are talking about,849.0070013346003,3118.80223202526,13940.978432562513,18797.426184296328

chinas traditional national identity is literially meaning us and them distinction it was traditionally done culturally in which chinese were people that embraced the chinese culture there are weird spots like china traditionally had people that were not of the nation simply by having a more primitive lifestyle the best term is likely indigenoustribal people taiwan had chefdoms and tribal leaders qing treated differently now the qing manchu rulers was actually pissed when those han scholar officials wanted to group their homeland outside of china by using this china proper term to mean only ming china with han majority is real china qing only outer china i would say the use of empire as a word is less meaningful than actual substance of history the manchu homeland northeast would be the odder places to say it is somehow an empirecolonial land to be given self determination at this stage of the game the likely result would be rejected if you actually held a vote today the concept of country is different for every country in my view it is the indefined spirit of a people and international law is simply rough outlines somw draw from history before the modern nation state concept existed,1284.4794837657612,4838.165325903686,21456.692527269184,26696.099385512654

i also think if talibans priority is to pick new fight rather than governing fata makes more sense first of all its impossible to get kashmir by pushing insurgents through the border pakistan has been trying for years with no success without a proper war you can not get kashmir and why would taliban want to get in war with india rather than focusing on its own country but fata is different majority of its population is pashtun and there is already an insurgency going on with ttp and local population help fata makes more sense for taliban if they are interested in expansion as they share border with territory whereas they get nothing by fighting for kashmir at best pakistan will get kashmir its not like taliban will rule over kashmir,881.6933406178744,3522.0163000517846,17650.153321034915,25377.10789737936

they are a paper tiger if you have worked with politicians you will know they are not as sophisticated as their manufactured public image would suggest they are just average joes with the same level of political views as your average joe now these ccp politicians also manufacture an image of being a very streamlined professional decision making body who knows what exactly is up and very competent they are not their level of thinking on issues is the same as if you were casually chatting with a random reasonably informed person about politics these ccp folks are equally as prone to miscalculations trump looks haphazard and like he does not have his shit together because he can not keep his mouth shut if like every other politician he just stuck to the prepared talking points that bureaucrats prepare he would be just fine not talking about his political views,1081.7756479407146,3711.5833579558125,16599.402132277522,25342.580973663185

people forget that afghanistan was a peaceful happy country for decades until the soviets showed up afghanistan has always existed just fine with a weak central government that defers to the individual provinces and ethnic groups to rule themselves no reason that can not work again if all sides realize they can coexist trouble with the taliban is they do not follow that model they want absolute central authority to enforce their way of life cultures and values on everyone strict sharia law is great if that is what you believe but at its heart afghanistan is a very freedom loving country always has been,833.5603004601835,3004.8818579102544,16741.724282631418,23668.07728215366

it was not just beijing go pick up lousa lims peoples republic of amnesia or even a copy of the tiananmen papers which is just a collection of cpc internal party documents from the incident there were protests all over china demanding transparency reform and an opening up of government posts to nonparty members along with press freedoms and a lifting of hukou restrictions for rural migrants none of those are inherently dangerous if done correctly party leadership was made up of old hardliners from the cultural revolution and people like deng and li peng who advocated violent suppression of the protests most of them had visions of a return to the bad days of a logical fear given their experiences but not grounded in the reality of the reform movement the may movement was far more than the few beijing protest leaders that managed to get across the border into hong kong or taiwan,1399.1293798745091,4648.121070023647,18911.772045381036,25730.324950842794

because it is annoying as fuck they act like they are better than us and you westerners believe them wholeheartedly hk and taiwan you have given the hong kongers a pass in everything they have done and what exactly has been done to them by the hk police vs what they have done themselves is a complicated topic but it is indisputable that they are not gandhilike also sinophobic people have been using hong kong as an example of why chinese culture has always been trash and i do not mean modern culture i mean chinese culture since we discovered the yellow river why because hong kong was british for a while they are not better than us nor are they different they are just angry frustrated teens demanding democracy but i can not stress that they are cantonese with a little bit of british a cultural subdivision of chinese taiwan okay just do not say they are a different ethnicity and i am good also do not ever say they are better because they strayed from chinese culture they are better than the prc because they stuck to traditional culture and caught up with the liberalization of governments happening in the west xinjiang and tibet the west just has too many people that try to separate us hans from these other ethnicities that suddenly have perfect morals because they are against the ccp they are not you should honestly treat them like you treated the scottish you did not chant free scotland you just analyzed the situation trying to secede from the uk or catalonia from spain but suddenly everyone is so invested in tibet and the uighurs because of the humans rights abuses demand humane handling but leave the geopolitical dispute to us and them we chinese want tibet and xinjiang to remain as part of china because anytime a country does not split it dodges economic loss while i hate that my country is communist i would like if it was not a communist shithole anymore and tibetans then uighurs fucking off will just because problems dissidents like me would prefer they just do their best to survive until we get a regime change,712.3392204718795,2019.0561483826195,9721.212751734049,15500.880145980007
how does it feel knowing hong kong is and always will be a part of china we already knew that the issue was china agreed to respect hong kongs autonomy until they wiped their ass with that agreement like they do with every other agreement it is good to see the world finally realizing agreements with china are not worth the paper they are written on glad to see countries like the uk and others giving hong kongs best and brightest a path out of hong kong as china turns it into an authoritarian shit hole,801.2670822737908,2588.091285928396,13939.361574711966,19753.83172970755

it did not help the ana was basically lying to us about the situation too they claimed they had thousand troops ready that could be mobilized in the end thousand were actually there to be mobilized which is less than the estimated taliban numbers most of their vehicles did not readily have spares or fuel available all their info was being fed to the taliban through spies and officials all throughout the military and government were pre bribed by the taliban to turn sides the taliban started their plan over a year ago after making the deal with trump they never intended to let us leave peacefully once they knew at some point we would be gone they started formulating and making solid connections in the government i think they actually did better than they expected because the afghani government capitulated long before evacuations would have been close to done we were starting evacuations when the dominos just started falling,991.0049742878186,3725.746283672087,19749.057372588904,27042.557934202174

where you guys get your sources that the chinese government says nothing happened it is an exaggeration the ccp does say things happened but their narrative is fake do you claim the waco incident was a massacre um what does this have to do with anything what you think happens when usa kills terrorist is there collateral damage ok you are comparing the killing of innocent bystanders to the pla opening fire indiscriminately on civilians all over beijing in order to suppress a political movement the official chinese government figure is dead you know so many people were there you can find people today who were there my friends were there you really want to do this,718.8478272008495,2593.305657732692,14385.854194503168,20180.756558076362

allow me to jump in i have two contentions to your argument thus far i think you are saying that the different presidencies will reach similar to foreign crisis due to the advisement of existing bureaucracy which span across decades but i believe it is the other way around presidents have their own agendas and they will react differently due to their political background but will turn to the bureaucracy to see what is the best way to carry out those visions for examples ikes operation ajax nixons operation rolling stone and reagans irancontra were all fundamentally different from their predecessors in terms of strategic objectives and degree in violation of international laws trump may or may be show a similar degree of interest towards the chinataiwan situation i frankly do not believe trump listens to advises at least not to a degree that you think how similar other presidents were you are right that obama is probably similar to say clinton and the bushes in terms of listening to foreign affair advisors but trump is a different bred first he has already showed he is not listening to bureaucratic advises in the dealing with the state department homeland security defense department and even within the white house staff tillerson mattis nielsen kelly at least the three former cabinet members resignedfired due to disagreement on policies in nielsens case it was a matter of constitutional violation sorry i just do not see trump as someone who would act due to advises rather he would seek advises so he can act on his own agenda,1533.793321219999,4202.317020166442,18566.58834351061,29497.437012942668

if it was always that easy libya syria etc would have turned out differently they had plenty of heavily armed people willing to put their lives on the line but this did not result in functioning democratic governments that could unite diverse groups of people the most recent revolution you mentioned happened years ago and all happened in countries with a stronger national identity and strong economic potential they are not comparable to afghanistanalso keep in mind the government not the average civilian had weapons now the taliban has those weapons they also have lots of combat experience fight the long fight and are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve power going up against them without a broad base of support and behind the scene logistics would be foolish you are not going to defeat the taliban with some localized riots and sticksstones,864.3078432806016,3007.782134724314,16667.783011001946,24372.920801202137

fine you want to talk about it then dont hate me for speaking my mind since you asked for it here is the full reply that you seem to demand from me geezus it is good that you at least admitted that us has strategic ambiguity there is a reason for that it is just a way for both parties to have a ceasefire but not yet finalise anything or conclude the civil war so they can continnue to run their economies and finish the fight later on so legally speaking i do not see taiwan as being a full independant country and do not appreciate partisan gaslighting they are at best a defaco country considering their status is still being decided by a civil war the reality is that the us does not have ultimate power over other countries domestic affairs they wanted taiwan to take over china way back in the s but they relaised that the mainland today is just not easily defeated if anything it seems pretty clear that chinas military is increeaisnly able to defeat taiwan these days you can say that taiwan is an indepednatn soverign state republic of china and you can argue this all you want saying that the civil war does not exist and that the chinese civil war is actually a myth and propaaganda created by china except i am bloody aussie mate and not a dumb cunt so do not treat me as one and think you can fool me into thinking the civil war does not exist it only works on people who are completeley unfamiliar with the topic even though i see myself as neutral expat doing business in guanzhou and also studied mandarin in taipei i never once pretended that taiwan is part of peoples republic of china nor did i ever pretend that taiwan is a full country without dispute i jus see things as they really are and ignore the spun propaganda so do not try to bs me you will not change my mind and i am not interested in reading your arguments that is just honestly gaslighting which i dont appreciate this is what i know and understand china and taiwan are at civil war china won the first major one and hence the un rewarded china with the seat at the un and kicked taiwan out however taiwan has still not been fully defeated however china has a legal right to finish their civil war and take taiwan by un charter laws people saying that taiwan is an indepedant country it is fine you can say that all you want but the reality still is going to remains that it is not an official recognised fact that the civil war has ended just stratgeic ambuigity to enable a ceasefire for now i do not recognise that taiwan is part of chinayet i see taiwan as separate for now but i also see civil war as never legally ended and i learn the history from my wife who is a sinophile that chiang kaishek was actually from the mainland shocker i know lol and his mainland gov was challenged by the rebels and he was defeated however not completely he fled to taiwan took a lot of gold and treasuires with him and holed up in taiwan which was already part of china back then the chinese tried to finish the civil war but lacked a proper navy after years they have been buildng up their navy to finsh the civil war legally under un charter laws the civil war has never ended and they can invade taiwan as long as taiwan has not resolved the chinese civil war they are a de facto independant run state at best but never a full indepednat countr that is just reality and not going to pretends it is anything else because of people political stances deep down you know the civil war is ongoing and that means that taiwan can never be a fully indepdant and internaionally eecognised country unless the civil war has been resolved so do not give me your intellectual arguments aimed to change my mind i am not one of those people who hate china and hence pretend they have no right for a civil war that is the definition of brainwashing so do not send me another reply unless you actually admit that taiwan s status is still affected by civil war cos i am not having it,779.883708046534,2136.509541680174,11333.867604927771,19813.220477682444

speaking as a native chinese it is kind of funny in a weird way chinese admire people with high intellectrelated traits so jews iq germans engineering and doctors lawyers engineers that is because of our dotestgetjobbureaucracy culture black people never get mentions because chinese have not seen what they can offer so they just shove a stamp on and call it a day same goes for muslims you do good on test you good personmorally japanese and koreans us and uk are used as enemies of the state to drive off democracy so they never get mentioned unless some disaster happen then we will celebrate it chinese pride is probably the easier word when trying to understand the chinese racism it is less of you are lower more of we are on top probably has something to do with the fact that china is enclosed geographically making us think china is the whole world but i do believe there are a lot of little things added up to make it they way it is today the claim is obviously not imperial but just observation of my own language and how often words are used and mentioned now i think of it that this do test get job social environment is exactly why we admire those we do publicly or secretly it is because we can obviously see what we can steal from them making those traits our own and better them it is a decently common idea you can see that in huawai chinese international students international academic bribery chinese law that say citizen must learn skills and bring back to china,780.4445734532342,3368.1808775637355,16991.202119982285,27203.288739747768

the alternative would literally have been a massive population my grandmother was the th child of her family lack of education and available protection which would have led to starvation on an unprecedented scale worse than the mao era so yeah it is what it is whattt it would not have led to starvation on an unprecedented scale that is stupid whoever told you this is stupid if you thought of it yourself then you are stupid at best at worst you are a bot i consider when the policy officially started china had a growth rate of while usa was and india was at a decade later in china actually had a growth rate of the time scale of population growth is too slow to outstrip the means of production that is absurd we would be on the brink of starvation at all times if a growth rate could threaten our survival so immediately this is the tragedy of what happened to the chinese people just mindless brainwashed by propaganda can not even think for themselves logically how anyone upvoted this garbage is beyond me moving people from rural villages to cities and changing their economic status to middle class is leaps and bounds more effective for slowing birth rates go look at the birthrate graph and the gdp growth graph and compare them,974.4434023579429,3769.6898813480034,17168.938804934358,25042.466071892413

i just find that if you think critically about pretty much any point you are arguing they can not win there is always that turning point in the conversation where they think they have cornered you and go for the jugular but what they do not realize is that you can have two viewpoints that are not necessarily contradictory unless you believe any line of propaganda yes you can hate trump and still be against the ccp hating him overall does not mean you do not agree with him on at least some points,524.6811126914889,1343.116963061219,9884.886967184282,19099.15564706883

the army is not a lot of those soldiers do not even exist can not give a specific number but you can search up for yourself if you want to find out moresome soldiers did want to fight back but were told not to by higher ups said that there was not any point the taliban was going to win anyway there are videos of thismen are the head of the household some did not even try fighting back because they are the breadwinners of their families and do not want to leave all the women fatherless or without brothers they may have weapons but they were not trained for war they did not know strategy they did not know how to actually lead a battle who should stay behind what roles each person has it was mainly american soldiers that did this during their time in afghanistanthere was no backup nobody in a helicopter to aid them if they lost after fighting the taliban had backup not in the form of a helicopter but they were better at strategy these men live in urban areas and mountains and caves several taliban members were in the ana as well obviously they were spies as well,621.3917830040158,1949.5803599539393,12794.095904833759,25295.82256652993

it will not be monumentus but look at it a different way firstly there will be an awareness increase that is an easy one but additionally think of the afghans in amsterdam and holland in general they may feel more supported particularly if they still have family there peoples actions towards because support are often heavily judged as though you either have to solve the problem or do nothing its ok to contribute to any effectsunfortunately in my experience people who are most likely to criticise protests marches or whatever else which do not have a direct effect are the least likely to do anything at all this may not be you and sorry to imply thatedit another example imagine being even in afghanistan and seeing that cities around the world are watching supporting and flying a flag you can no longer fly yourself that is got to feel good does it solve the problem obviously not i doubt anyone at this march feels like they are fixing the issueedit fixed a few words which made no sense,829.2141311912575,3418.5230700961038,17701.423622355313,26913.689925344057

imagine if you will you are the child of a businessman the town you grew up in is nothing special even lacking in a few areas but there is still a sense of local pride you are father encourages you all your life to be studious and seek a respectable job time goes by and you find a job at a local government office as you work there your local area undergoes development and the local economy improves the look of the town all your family and friends you knew at school seem to be doing well a practice arises where local criminals names are broadcast to the public you do not think much of it you were never encouraged to think about these things at most you reckon well it serves them right i can not imagine why anyone would do such a thing to their own community you move on with your life a decade on and you have climbed up the ranks due to your reputation as a hard worker and some contacts on your fathers part you now work in an office that oversees the entire region of the country your town resides in you find out a large portion of the region is militarized land you never knew that well there is garrisons all over the country only stands to reason at home your once small town is practically a small city all thanks to government funding and you feel you played no small part in the matter you lost contact with some friends but that is okay as everyone does and the friends and family you still have are great you are even engaged to a fantastic partner life could not be better the local shaming practice extends to minor offences such as public indecency and not paying bills the cheek of some people another decade goes by you have a beautiful daughter a loving wife and have been promoted to the position of ambassador leading up to this point you have been informed of worldly affairs a brief background on other countries you would only heard about by name until now and information as to why part of the region you lived in is militarized a small republic had agreed to join the peoples republic of china in the past but religious extremists choose to incite violence holding the authority of their theistic bedtime stories above leadership of your fine country this is the reasom why that area you had never heard about is militarised to keep the peace you do not think about the fact that you never knew the town you grew up in was not always a part of china you were not taught to question it all this information is learned through memos provided to you by the government they sure take vetting seriously round here you do your duty to your country you are living abroad with your family with your own security team provided by your government your job is to explain complex internal affairs in simple ways that foreigners can understand you have been told to dispel any misinformation circulated by foreign governments looking to sabotage the unity your country has worked so hard for you never think to take any of this misinformation as truth you were not taught that your government could do anything wrong but let us say you notice that there is security cameras in places that seem entirely unnecessary why would ypu question it you hear one of your pld school friends disappeared without a trace after trying to undermine local laws seems reasonable you hear of a man that tried to flee the country after commiting a serious crime and the police force threatened to detain his family if he did not turn himself in perhaps a tad extreme but you know the police they would never actually go through with it its just doing what needs to be done better not dissapoint your government now they might pretend threaten your family too you hear noncombatants are being detained in the militarised area a tragedy but it can not be helped they did not suppress their own neighbours from violence after all complicit in a crime is just as bad as commiting it so when you are asked to interview by the foreign news corporation that does not censor malicious lies and rumors about this complicated issue in your region you try your best to explain it in simple terms the region is beautiful and grade place to life in the democratic republic of china the moment you were born to hanchinese parents you were already up to your kneck in a system which encourages conformity and discipline and discourages critical thinking and empathy this is the nature of china under beijing,852.2096275138698,3843.5567529718905,21678.16923520916,32693.75544470649

taiwan has always been a province of china according to the international consensus which is supported by the united nations and its member states so there is no such thing as a referendum in taiwan given that only a national government can have the authority to hold one and taiwan does not have a national government at least within the bounds of taiwan it does not taiwans true national government is the government of china the government of china has not held any referendums regarding samesex marriage lately or ever taiwan is not the first country in asia to legalise samesex marriage since it is not a country what taiwan is is a terrorist organization occupying land which rightfully belongs to china and apparently the only way to successfully introduce marriage equality to asia is through terrorist activity maybe the terrorists are the good guys and the real countries are the bad guys,639.3165062160884,1954.34614244801,11952.035082010063,21137.6120647865

i said this in literally the first comment why do people still think china tries to ban any information on june th incident when all you need to do to disprove it is to search it on baidu how do you still not understand my main argument are you just ignoring that so you can keep arguing i said that because you said and i quote i am hoping your point was not the duh fact that it has to be censored on search engines otherwise the ccp is wasting their money blocking it everywhere else i said you are ignoring my argument in my literal first comment which you clearly imagined what it was despite the wording could not be more clean and succinct yesagain no idea what your point here is your search is not very clear since the first result is about and the i think you mean to search with at least or at the very least the year in the keywords i put the link there because you said this yes it is censored on baidu that was my whole pointi do not think you have any more idea what you want to say yourself even your next post will prove me right and if you had bothered to check my link the second article is literally from the cpc news and it gave a detailed run down of every thing that happened during the whole june th incident in plain words httpcpcpeoplecomcngbhtml so you lied again so baidu have either deleted the results about tiananmen not that you even searched for that anyway lol etc etc lots of ad hominem people downvoted you because nobody has any idea what you want to say i really hope that ad hominem is not your only point because you have yet to argue or say anything that is not lie again my first comment made my point very clear and you are the only person that seems to purposefully ignore that lol i wonder what you areuse some whataboutism and prove it you clearly do not know what whataboutism is because i have yet to bring up any point about western hypocrisy i do not intend to continue this because you have done nothing so far besides sophistry ignoring facts and lie you clearly do not bring good intentions to a discussion so i do not bother,657.3806093277603,2284.0287892388474,13916.804087638146,21847.52947022905
the united nations do not even recognise taiwan as its own country but a part of china after the roc lost the chinese civil war in the mainland if china invades then legally the un charter prohibits any country from coming to taiwans defense the only reason why china has not is because war on taiwan and the damage they would do would not be ideal they however would not allow taiwan to declare independance so war is only most likely if taiwan actually declares independance if they do not the status quo will continue as it has for the last decades not all of taiwan is proindependence either some want peaceful reunion whereas others want independence regardless it is still a domestic matter among the chinese in which china does have a legal right under international laws to claim taiwan and conclude the chinese civil war despite they already won officially back in s but america interferes as they need a proxy regarless unless taiwan wins the civil war or the un recognises it as its own country and there are solid reasons why that will not really convince me that they are an international recognized country,763.0989689801686,2047.3333544111847,11134.07938810191,18139.979693014757

seriously the taliban expected us to leave them hundreds of fully operational aircraft and vehicles but the us military rendered a number of them inoperable before leaving why do you think that is obviously we do not want them armed with our highly effective weaponry although they seem to be pretty capable without it unfortunately,1026.90493432383,2476.84861605745,9724.662477255019,15053.224531981694
so basically in conclusion is that everyone is guilty i agree on every accusation you made do not get me wrong i just want to make clear that all of the claims are real horrible inexcusable at any time does not make the hitler sized concentration camp system happening right now in xinjiang holding uighur people and unlike what people may think they are in most hon chinese party members usually are openly racist and this is only exasperated with propaganda that is pro hon race and bringing china back to a time of maoism but with xi instead vox made a great essay about the topic i found it after doing my research but is a great lesson on the hitory of uighur and other ethnic minority in xinjiang freaky because for the first time we have video of almost everything these days and seeing for example the video going around online maybe you spotted it on john olivers episode about the uighurs is one issue that bothers me someone who works on a film set for a living and more and more i hear writers complaining about appeasing chinese censors in no time in history has china had such a hold on our own medias ability to tell us the truth about the dark side of their country this i remind you is just a written oppiece by me and realize a gigantic part of hom chinese people are obviously freedome wanting loing people as well i am just concerned about the issues mentionned,962.1792576046289,3495.6914717056693,20512.36839953299,29044.558990192032

right but a lot of these people were at the airport before the arrival of taliban in the city so i doubt the taliban after pretty much achieving what they set out to do will havemake time to access what is happening at the airport come up with a plan to infiltrate the refugees then execute it by having one of their members completely change their style of dress shave their faces and manner of speaking to get pass the usa to get on the flight this would require a lot of advance planning and say this is the usa as soon as they arrive in their next location they will have to go through an entire bureaucratic process before they will be considered refugees and given american citizenship the us would not take the risk,661.6034418599428,2186.8659451011013,13827.040181024204,23732.828876339372

the rest of asia spoke chinese for quite a few centuries we do not live in the th century we live in the st century the rest of asia does not speak chinese now so how is that germane japan still have high regards for the tang dynasty japan is divesting from china now tang dynasty high regard notwithstanding japan korea and vietnam historically all branched off china in terms of culture i would like to hear what japan korea and vietnam say about their roots in china i doubt it dovetails so neatly give japan and korea their sovereignty back and see who they would aline themselves with south korea and japan are not sovereign today you really think a majority of south koreans and japanese prefer china over the west both of those countries waged literal war with china how are they allies also ask any ordinary africans how they feel about white people it is all in the books true but this does not mean their anger and distrust of whites translates into friendship and trust with china it is possible to distrust more than one entity africans fury at china is raging now and this is not impacted one bit by their distrust of whites if china had a chance to ally with africa in solidarity against the west that opportunity died with the virus outbreak and racism against black africans in guangzhou the south china sea contains crucial trade routes for china and you would expect china to just have absolute influence there china does not assert influence they assert total control like the us gets to protect freedom of navigation by not signing in with unclos the us acts on behalf of its own interests but also in conjunction with the other asian nations who have a better claim to the south china sea than china in fact china has the weakest claim among all asian nations the spratly scam will turn out exactly the same as chinas efforts in africa a costly misfire you can not simply consolidate the ccp into a unified body of pure malice and claim that they did not do the bad things simply because they wanted but could not i can not decipher this sentence,1014.5169814735294,3752.79827994135,17816.945494158037,29465.612624032037

a segment of the young people are really into identity fetishes that is western identity fetishes so listening to western english langauge music taking hip hop dance lessons adopting western social media fads western dress styles european and american cars slang and moving away from their traditional chinese ways there is still a strong sense of the chinese ethnic and cultural identity but the tide in major cities and in educated circles is shifting,2380.5900605924785,5904.281106785952,19244.40095778304,21034.078867124997

the us does not need to be perfect in order to criticize china guantanamo bay is a weak comparison to chinas systematic detention and torturing of it is own domestic dissidents i suppose by this logic china is no different than the us we had slavery years ago so forced labor camps for the uyghurs can not be criticized totally asinine,904.6894174671852,1939.9386692838523,9087.744230368455,13171.373959223418

ha but this is not privilege or anything like that talking i am speaking more in terms of judging how chinas leadership acts they bully countries that they see as weak in the international economy and political order and they see canada is big enough to matter but small enough to get away with occasionally taking pot shots at hence the canadians who have been detained tortured and threatened with death in reaction to the huawei lady getting arrested in canada since it is in reaction to an american extradition request in principle you would think that they would have retaliated by trumping up charges against american nationals in china but they have not because they see the us as too powerful economically and politically to screw with in that way it makes for a strange reversal actually in the s i knew americans who when they traveled to europe would put a canadian maple leaf on their backpacks because they did not want to deal with europeans bugging them about whatever george w bush was up to or the latest war on terror catastrophe in iraq generally canadians had an easier time when it came to international travel than their american counterparts but now in china you are probably much safer if you are an american than if you are a canadian,973.1750142261194,3727.4114146163975,18664.376453890793,29151.47375469849

i think humans are naturally tribalistic and conforming and that individuals making decisions in a vacuum are usually pretty good but it is when humans are in a collective that things get tricky that is why they say groups larger than are not ideal because group think starts to kick in and people who are naturally dominant will ride over and have more influence than those less dominant regardless of the quality of their ideas,936.5105771864133,3622.0949706139104,15588.524146926175,19466.671619098383

that might be me i have been making posts about american occupation in afghanistan and that is been one of my primary points of contentionin my mind i would say that five years would have been enough to allow the younger generation to start entering into the military and government with over six million people entering into adulthood in the next five years that would provide them with a chance to show their worth and their compatriots to strengthen the government so that a collapse like we have seen might not have happened the children of the st century were those that held the future of afghanistan and staying until would have allowed them to come up in enough numbers to defend the republic if they were willing to do so since we were only spending billion a year with operation freedoms sentinel less than one percent of our total revenue for a year back in and since our losses have been comparatively small to nearly every american war the costs would not have been heavy for how much good it could have accomplished,751.3962253693695,2736.7481390157172,17268.272358448543,27248.35489715915

you say that but what is your metric some articles are definitely biased but overall it is a great source of information the biased articles are political not necessarily historical in the case of why the cpc blocked wikipedia it was because it held information the cpc does not want the chinese people to know and i guess somebody in hong kong made a point of telling people to look it all up on wikipedia in china knowledge of tiananmen is limited to whatever tourists might find interesting they do not teach the kids about what happened there and the narrative they do spin is one where the cpc claims it was a bunch of thugs who tried to overthrow the government no mention of university students the massacre the cpc committed or what the actual requests were nopejust claims that it was an attempted coup like a million people just had nothing better to do apparently,654.0594252812338,2454.193018288195,15517.864799992727,25554.994261834843

well i admire your optimism but i disagree with your statement trump has reinforced alliances all around the world all of asia is happy to have trump as president except china trump has finally stepped up arming ukraine against the russians which obama refused there are tons of examples where trump is actually reinforcing american leadership in positive ways but the media twists the narrative every second your fair world foreign policy sounds nice but in practice more people would be worse off take saudi arabia we should stop arming them right sounds nice they are not fighting the war in yemen simply because we give them weapons without the us providing advanced weaponry that reduces civilian casualties saudi would be unleashed in a much more brutish way they would resort to barrel bombs artillery larger ground invasion it would be a much more brutal war and without the us sitting in the room the world would turn a blind eye and believe it or not saudi cares less about human rights than the us and they would be free to conduct the war their way but hey not selling them guns sounds nice right not to mention if iran succeeds in using a terrorist proxy to overthrow yemens government in a coup that would be disastrous bernies obsession with what sounds nice is ultimately a dangerous navet,1289.9219076978252,4836.518163529048,21426.017137081002,29450.611293997375
i understand the us has its faults and bad deeds people are too quick to put them on a par with china though the us does not silence its citizens and deny them a right to free expression in anything like the way china does the uighur camps tibet and so many other things are wrong in china when people try and either suggest that americans are as oppressed or that trump is as bad as xi i have to disagree i am from nz and i am in australia i agree with your sentiment i think the us is not the best place to be in the free world canada nz and australia are pretty good much of europe is great it is telling that in this day and age the us and uk both were meant to be leaders in the world both failed miserably with this pandemic now trump wants to open things back up the us is seriously in decline it is awful to watch i would not want to move there,486.1188865431983,1901.263724242967,14371.981710328371,25249.902404832646

does not the article answer your own question he defected after us began its strikes later he was disowned by the taliban in other words he was not willing to fight a losing battle massoud was the first to warn the useu and he was the key person struggling against the taliban hoping they will assist his people,931.5822282857109,2977.0079633856217,10974.380457666643,15672.255404440237

so i kind of get the historical explanation but i want to see how someone in contemporary chinese society can work their head around the obvious logical errors in their thinking as you mentioned many chinese consider that china is on top but how can they simultaneously hold the view that china is the greatest country on earth whilst also believing that china can only succeed by stealing foreign ideas do they not understand that if you need to cheat or steal to succeed then it heavily implies that you were never good enough to reach that level by yourself how can one be so proud of oneself if one has to acknowledge ones own inferiority also do people not understand that actually cheating is not helping china at all the whole world can see when the ccp plays dirty tricks and it only serves to give china a very bad global reputation it is not that the world is too weak to stop china from cheating or too stupid to notice its just that the world has been very tolerant of china up until quite recently in the hope that they would continue to improve living standards in the country but if the ccp continues to act with arrogance and hostility then they will find that suddenly the world is not so willing to look the other way for their sake one thing i have always noticed that is very deeply rooted in chinese society is this kind of shortsightedness with a stubborn insistence to only focus on shortterm gains i honestly find that chinese people have a very difficult time thinking through the longterm consequences of their actions and can see no further than how their actions immediately benefit themselves and their families even if such actions would cause you ruin just minutes later,758.0732865616175,2881.722031560672,18495.27297388186,29775.948371952923

id argue that the kurds are a united nation without an actual bordered nation in my opinion the first step to fixing the middle east is to cut out parts of iraq syria turkey and iran and creating kurdistan likely will not happen but needs to my point is that the kurds are not tribal within their own nation they are a united group of people if they had a kurdistan they would never let a terrorist group simply walk over and take the country over look at how hard they fought over their semiautonomous region in iraq and syria against isis in,896.5750189170612,3048.0876263391006,16171.02253702605,24692.238002261132

while i think what is going on in china is absolutely wrong and must be stopped i also think it is not great to be hyperbolic by calling it genocide to me when we call racial or religious oppression genocide it lessens the importance of groups in history who were actually mass murdered then when china inevitably does start murdering them we will not even notice from headlines since it is been called genocide from the beginning what is happening is already really awful and we do not need to spice it up with exaggeration,729.9184430505123,2342.4141518702536,12060.496862686523,19234.521122265094

if your definition of suppressing information is that media does not cover it then we have a different definition of suppressing information the event was years ago and i doubt any media would cover it after and the usage of the internet was not even popular until in china well one of the examples from the definition of information suppression is biased or selective representation of sourcesthat appears to be exactly what is happening here on baidu they do not report it today for the same reason why the bonus army massacre is not reported it is not news and no one cares anymore a brand new word for you history i think you will find we have articles talking about events from way way before tiananmensurprised you had no idea about that i thought the argument was that the cpc suppresses information how moronic the cpc would have to be to suppress information by displaying everything there is to know in a chronology the most unbiased way you can record an event unbiased lol the ccp about tiananmen yeah i bet they said it was a huge mistake on their part and had great humility in their article and super unbiased results in baidu with every result not certified by the ccp completely and utterly removed i do not see how they can be any more impartial i have already demonstrated my coherency in english yes especially the part about adding a lot of padding on to my back what is this is this what you classify as a coherent english sentence yes it is a perfectly fine sentence grammatically use this and you will see go over there and you will find it etc etc post it on some english learning forum and see if they say it is incorrect your guess is wrong the point is not about your arguments being fallacious it is about your intentions and actions only arguments can be fallacious you intentionally manipulated the idea of suppressing information from preventing people from knowing about it to what i assume limiting its distribution channel that is literally the definition of information suppressionpreventing people from knowing a certain thing or fact ie that website is not in the list of results on baidu all of this stupid point about suppressing information is ignoring the fact that vpn is the most accessible thing in china only behind public washrooms but i do not need to argue this point because what we have is enough to debunk your claim that is a dumb statement in so many ways you obviously have not been to china in about years if you do not know that it is getting more and more difficult to get a vpnand not to mention the fact that you do need one more than of the population do not have oneso yes if you need a vpn most people will not see that informationthus the information has been suppressed you are like the black knight from monty python the holy grail you would not admit defeat even with every one of your arguments torn into pieces which are clearly demonstrated here i will give you credit for continuing with it despite all your ad hominem excuses to run away like brave sir robin so far your argument is information suppression by definition as i quoted above somehow does not constitute information suppression according to you sorry but that is not even a flesh wound so far no i meant exactly what i said i am powerless to stop the spreading of lies and i will not continue this waste of time you do not have ccp resources they can easily stop the spread of information if you do reply again and do not in fact do your brave sir robin impression please also include some links to people chatting about tiananmen on weibobecause it is not suppressed right,757.9921234743667,2508.302525983758,13596.38496029031,23329.800029572405

do you think that geopolitics between china and the west will be driven by academics you understand why china engages in propaganda but you do not understand the importance of what common people feel and believe come on so living in the west would you call the police on your neighbor edit and so what about biases chinese nationalists are proudly biased but westerners should be cultural relativists and as for laowhy he told that story to say this is something that would surprise westerners about china because that is something that would surprise westerners the police will not interfere with a familys affairs when they should that you talk about his negative bias means you missed the point we would probably all have that bias we would all expect that guy to go to jail for breaking a universal law laowai was offering that as a warning to not judge or at least to judge the whole system and as for the idea that the west should just leave china alone i do not think that it works like that in the current age china should close off to protect it is chineseness hey did you ever entertain the idea that maybe chineseness is not really worth protecting i mean maybe it is but maybe not should not ideas compete and we will see which wins my bet is on a western outlook we have already seen how chinese people prefer their modern western lifestyles infuriatingly arrogant is not it,714.1058703151174,2825.0929021492734,16768.116518016785,26898.51165007752

if there was it would need to be demonstrated for example if i want to claim that reporting from the nyt is biased in a leftofcenter direction i can not just point out that the reporter who wrote the story is a registered democrat and think i have proven my case i need to get into the details to demonstrate how the story omits relevant context cherrypicks data was not wellsourced etc to think otherwise would entail that there is no such thing as objective reporting or scholarship because we all have opinions and priors so merely pointing out that someone has an opinion is not enough to indict something as biased for that will doubly be true of any chinesestatebacked source in this case zenz has been clear that the kind of contraception we are talking about is not voluntary the most radical feminists would oppose involuntary contraception as much as the fundie xtian would and frankly i find this particular smear to be a weird one fundamentalist christians are not known for their celebration of islamic religious practices so if he is sounding the alarm on muslims being oppressed that would make it even more credible coming from him of course i prefer to simply look at the quality of the data it speaks for itself regardless of zenzs personal views,1073.969074372237,3412.3222520153213,18070.71002667025,27184.355241844438

omg lmao hahahaha you just rejected un charter laws which is global yet actually went on to have accepted montevideo convention which is basically a weaker organisation but also has laws accepted as international laws montevideo convention only recognizes states via a criteria but not countries that are fully recognised by the full complex extent of international laws that include un charters if taiwan had no civil war then you will be correct except there are larger laws outside that still disqualifies taiwan one of which is global acceptance and the fact that it is in civil war and what makes montevideo convention override un charter laws despite they are compatible that convention still does not have any legal effect on civil wars as long as there is a civil war unconcluded it can not be recognized as its own country and it already lost the first civil war in the s so technically by un eyes it is already chinese territorty also do you research as you are so dead wrong united states still recognise prc as having soverignthy over china look at the map below very few countries recognise taiwan japan france uk canada all recognises taiwan as part of china legally httpsworldpopulationreviewcomcountriescountriesthatrecognizetaiwan even america does not recognise it as such as they understand that a civil war can not be interfered by outsiders taiwan is a state but they are not a country according to the un charter which has many international laws taiwan is part of china and china is allowed by un charter to take taiwan by force the montevideo convention doesn not even prevent that,1128.4056599197738,2967.2694370577096,15625.396491719544,26707.95900187065

you are a liar yourself though lots of russians perhaps a majority truly are nostalgic about ussr thus the overwhelming support for annexation of crimea and the rest of ukrainian shitshow i do not approve of it nor do i think they would have preferred ussr to return if given a chance but such is reality as for orthodox christianity its revival began in the last decades of soviet rule already but the same group which would scoff at soviet patriotism is most likely to disdain religion as anyone with experience of the ground knows russian stalinism is more compatible with christianity than s prowestern liberalism which was protoprogressive in spirit it is only the ignorant outdated american idea of godless commies that drives the contrary stereotype they also do care about great power nationalism and culture war to the extent those arguments can be successfully used by state propaganda to dismiss economic worries and russians are the most chinafriendly people right now according to pew research if you want proofs chinese propaganda in this case is not all that far from reality certainly not as far as you are perhaps the sample of russians you know is unrepresentative but i am more inclined to believe that you are consciously doing everything you accuse the chinese of which ironically might only be too fitting judging by your username you preach to the choir of brainwashed westerners with this stupid gish gallop of random talking points knowing you will not be called out on your pretentious bullshit,1284.25195650114,4841.42970877331,19945.37205291624,28551.288477980303

that is not really an explanation of why they would take their sworn enemy and release them to fight against themit is when you believe that anybody engaging in jihad is an ally you are not likely to think strategically about these other groups this is what they did and there is a whole lot more they have not thought through either what is that say about the us if we could not beat a bunch of morons in yearsthat the us does not have the will to fight a counterinsurgency but this is irrelevant to the question of why the taliban was stupid enough to release isis fighters,490.7289852158382,1371.704002493845,8032.541209108675,15512.248055244561

yeah i wonder if conspiracy theorists realize how hard it is to keep like a group of ten people on the same page on a freaking school project let alone countries with narcissistic leaders lol but i think the reason chinese people do think the rest of the western world is colluding is because chinese education teaches that the west worked together against china during the hundred years of humiliation there is a sense of payback to the west that underlines all their actions and them trying to gain allies with easternauthoritarian countries to go against western powers and why their people tend to side so vehemently with their government they feel they have finally risen up and they want payback,843.2787286034023,2475.178261397732,15676.111656427127,24108.34801898897

then you contradict yourself as your montvideo convention can also be rejected by other countries too i did not contradict myself there is no concrete definition of a country or state which is exactly why i said the montvideo convention was the most widely accepted definition of a state geezus you really are in denial if you are incapable of being able to use wikipeida and look it up then there is no point in arguing with this with you as you are inmcapable of understanding basic knowledge i am not in denial you are having an issue understanding basic english and the distinction between recognize and acknowledge next read the sentence that states the yousprc joint communiqu switched diplomatic recognition from taipei to beijing in the joint communiqu the united states recognized the government of the peoples republic of china as the sole legal government of china acknowledging the chinese position that there is but one china and taiwan is part of china where does it say the united states recognizes taiwan as part of china acknowledges the chinese position is not the same as recognizing it as the united states own position this was clear and verified further when the prc tried to change acknowledge to recognize and the deputy secretary of state warren christopher clarified that the work acknowledge is the term determinative for us policy if taiwan keeps the status quo and does not declare independence and china still invades the yous has signaled that it would come to taiwans defense but that would be one state china using force within its own territory to put down secessionists a la ukraine and almost certainly legal the status quo is an already independent taiwan furthermore you understand the un resolution did not decide or figure out the status of taiwan correct it simply stated who represents china,918.1008126214394,2411.2351775790303,10654.61499570963,16197.612116039909

right that is part of the paradox of north korea as states go they are uniquely despised and not especially strong or influential but because they have nothing to lose since no one wants to go to war against them they can abduct japanese nationals or an american tourist and suffer no real consequences honestly what else can be done to north korea that has not already been done short of war,863.9952845320507,2810.637803714359,12017.524919594745,17668.12179670654

well i would say that it would not change that much if they changed their political system think about it the us is one of the most controversial democracies in the world they influence the politics in many western countries like mine for example when the us got bush we got berlusconi same political stance when we got renzi they got obama when we got salvini they got trump these leaders have the same political stance maybe they are just coincidence but you can observe a similar influence in other european countries another direct fact is the scandal involving cambridge analytica the same company that made trump president is in fact the same company that made brexit possible a wonderful executed online campaign of propaganda that successfully manipulated the voters of two of the most important democracies in the world and only god knows how many more elections were influenced is this the democracy we want is there any difference between manipulated and forced to comply,920.2854122141209,3145.083101276217,15924.590738076922,25854.75501651979

whilst no country enters into these kind of relationships in an altruistic way to say that china is or will be worse than the us is not true in the eyes of many of the countries they are investing in leaked us cables show that they have been concerned for a long time that the chinese approach is preferred by many african states to the us one httpstheguardiancomworldusembassycablesdocuments a quote from a kenyan ambassador sunkuli said africans were frustrated by western insistence on capacity building which translated in his eyes into conferences and seminars they instead preferred chinas focus on infrastructure and tangible projects the lack of wars or a colonial history with china is also a positive for many nations as well as the straightforward chinese approach to getting hard infrastructure projects up and running with minimal political strings attached httpnewsbbccoukhiafricastm httpsmhuffpostcomusentry many countries consider china the lesser of two evils and rightfully so the us approach has historically been devastating for most countries read confessions of an economic hitman or naomi kleins the shock doctrine to get a flavour of how the us approaches the concept of aid and development in poor nations,1448.355018730084,5111.151699659182,18930.337169700848,28553.171567459496

to add taiwans current elected party in power is the dpp who reject the one china principle and maintain a that taiwan is already de facto independent the two main reasons why taiwan is still officially the republic of china and that they claim mainland china is fear of invasion from china if taiwan rocks the boat and taiwans constitution was written by the kmt when they were in the midst of the chinese civil war and to change it would require majority vote in their parliament the most seats the dpp got in parliament is around s,780.8317207127819,2895.6903227971657,13869.388572461268,20716.45155057875

take away some freedom to prevent the risk of dictators soldiers from massacring thousands of innocent people indiscriminately in the center of the capital city you are out of your mind the fact that you can come here to celebrate the gruesome barbaric arbitrary deaths of so many innocent people and engage in a disgusting disinformation campaign against them on this most sensitive of anniversary it defies the most basic principles of humanity bravo bravo and to think your reply to youghoststark seems to indicate that you do not even live in china you have access to all the information and have no reason to be slandering these poor victims except perhaps if you are sincere for your adherence to a twisted ideology shameful truly shameful people do not get banned purely for supporting the ccp or parroting party misinformation here but just the same i feel i must call you out for what you are saying,919.112833954337,2569.4122622526406,14261.563031850998,24032.79580211305
spot on i would also add that they believe preventing a nonpashtun nationalist government from taking power again keeps the durand line issue in a dormant state even though the taliban did not recognize it the last time around go figure,1118.7362249425696,3312.2149973874743,12640.8772530425,15085.958909503936
no it just gives its power to someone else this is wrong wealth is destroyed all the time it is also created all the time zerosum thinking is bad mkay if money had a power on par with what marx is claiming the world would be a lot different and no a pareto distribution of wealth does not mean that money has a mysterious power i am not saying it has no power just that it is not anywhere near the picture marx paints his thoughts remind me of poor people discussing how great life will be when they win the lottery we all know what happens in the majority of those cases,726.4245265551507,2165.5973919405938,12103.639270988377,20262.784391680652
troops and cars costs fuel food ammo money medical equipment spare parts water etc to move around it costs the taliban significantly more to take cities like these than it does for the northern alliance to make matters worse for them they can not simply send less people due to the amount of ana commandos and other trained soldiers the panjshir resistance has better troops than the taliban on a onetoone basis so they can not just send less troops and less vehicles as that jeopardizes their ability to capture terrain and citiesthis is almost the same situation isaf found itself in except that the taliban rankandfile was more than outmatched by coalition troops,1236.311943799071,4322.352251794581,18404.116915033734,25533.97200334833

tldr taiwan is a country because membership in the un is not a requirement for statehood rather it is a benefit of statehood which you apply to join httpswwwbbccomnewsworldasia this is not according to the un charter it is according to the un recognition the member list is made up of countries that meet this httpswwwunorgensectionsuncharterchapteriiindexhtml standard which is in the charter it is basically based on the number of other member countries that recognize a nation the un charter is a different thing from the membership list keep in mind a major requirement is that the un security council approves of a countries un membership china will never approve taiwans membership regardless of how many countries recognize it the listed global states can be divided into three categories based on membership within the united nations system un member states two observer states and other states it is still a state httpsenmwikipediaorgwikilistofsovereignstates,1000.442602199293,2840.329477688606,15967.613027999043,27497.596784761634

you do not really have a point we all know that racism is deeply embedded in chinese society but that does not mean it should be you seem to think that a demographic of well over million people almost of the population could somehow be easily swept under the carpet and ignored in a hypothetical democratic china what you are fantasizing is not a democracy it is life in china as it already exists today under the han chauvinist xi jinping but guess what the proportion of ethnic minorities to han is only going to keep increasing at the expense of the han the government did away with the one child policy and the han still are not churning out kids a few generations later you will find china having to import labor from africa south asia and southeast asia to do the jobs the middle class does not want to do anymore too,656.0559753987561,2250.3408335947497,13086.837206680437,21704.77750585604

adding to this china is likely going to be helping the taliban with infastructure they will be able to out invest and win the talibans favor but if russia and their sphere save panjshir then the nrf and former government within the nrf will see russia as saviors while america abandoned themplus as others pointed out russia did provide some assistance to america during the invasion of afghanistan,1089.3843473451268,4379.819204369095,19019.82374751288,21247.473197048217

that is entirely false there are several geopolitical narratives that are playing out at once and geopolitical objectives that the western policymakers hope to achieve that are far more complex than the average citizen assumes take a look at all the foreign policy statements and foreign policy directives released by western think tanks over the last several years the common theme of containing china and russia can clearly be seen then take a look at their directives on gaining a foothold in central asia and rolling back china and russian spheres of influence in the region its clear they were not able to defeat the tb so they made a deal with them and allowed them full control of the area that will create destabilization within the central asian countries through three main conduits which have already been established destabilization via refugees destabilization via narcotics destabilization via the spread of the fanatics from afgin the long run this is not a win for china at all to fully exploit afg minerals a tremendous amount of infrastructure needs to be built and this has not been feasible whatsoever in preceding decades china does not benefit from having a theocratic state directly on its border with xinjiang a province which has seen unrest in the past due to the cultural and religious makeup of the province,1247.0604945141292,3929.221447053681,18233.241973481898,27603.69164161881

actually big corporates like to do business in big protected markets in a totally free market anyone can try to enter into your line of business if competitors make the exact same product and quality it is resulting in less competitive advantage you have over your competitors and in an ideal free market the only way you can compete is by lowering your price up to the point neither one of you is making a profit but if you are a big company and you are the only one that gets a licence to operate in that niche of the industry you can protect your market share by paying enough bribes to the government not to give any licenses to people who want to enter your market niche so when dealing with a government that restricts market entry and you are the first one to break into a market to get a head start and establish yourself you will be laughing to the bank,769.521582491598,3006.6824372056435,17261.77468936768,26286.757248428094

wait genocide is now downgraded to cultural genocide no it is genocide based on forced sterilization and cultural genocide based on forced assimilation glad to know you think forced assimilation is justifiable so many people who can not understand any mandarin yet there is zero problems with my translation even you admit that she said if you know proper mandarin the girls uyghur name sounds like a curse word in mandarin and in arabic it is a beautiful name that means patient thanks for reiterating why it is a shitty idea to force the standards of your language and culture on others with their own languages and cultures that also explains why she was assuming that if she spoke bad words she would be scolded or beaten she said the word in a lighthearted way probably her parents said something like that to warn her not to use foul words if you believe a kindergarten in china nowadays could walk away with physically punishing kids you are an idiot so you came out here boasting your superior mandarin skillz not to correct a translation mistake but to try and downplay the gravity of what she said because you think it sounded lighthearted in all your spindoctoring you skipped over the connection between points a and b which is that she is literally reluctant to speak her own language even when prompted in the beginning they are asking her to say her brothers name but by the end they ask her to say her own name whatever your race in china you are supposed to speak mandarin at all times in school not your local dialect uyghur is not a dialect it is a language it is the indigenous language of that region and it is supposed to be recognized as an official language in that region on par with mandarin if that seems a terrible crime to you just feel lucky that you live in your perfectly equal and totally no racial segregation country and just remain happily ever after and leave china rot the way it should alright no thanks i do not want the uyghurs to rot so i will continue to speak out about the deplorable human rights violations going on there you do you though,863.4761827187322,2872.295681573576,15835.426507330145,24637.186125647437

it seems this notion that afghanistan has no national unity is at least somewhat false just looking at the taliban its clear they see afghanistan as a nation since they aim to take it over before them there was of course the communist government and the monarchy which both saw afghanistan as a nationi think the situation is more akin to the united states pre civil war people are more fond of their state or in afghanistans case their tribe but do understand the concept of a nation and that they are part of one,605.0120782746984,2128.232715233353,14671.33242618875,22322.834830840115
as a native bhutanese i would like to say that we do have our flaws poverty is a problem in some parts of the country nepotism and corruption do exist teens do commit sucide due to depression and all of the vices that is almost immisible with the very nature of humanity do exist here but to a lesser extent partly because we have a smaller population so there is less struggle for resources a bit of darwinism here and hence a smaller crime rate there is also a lack of organized crime in bhutan though you may hear of bhutanese smugglers caught smuggling this thing or that in certain airports usually india bangkok etc the smugglers themselves are often paid by some organisers and and are not a part of some criminal organisation based in bhutan we did have some gangs mb boys being the most notorious before like in the s but the police seem to have done a good job in dismantling them corruption and nepotism do exist but it does not exist in a sustainable manner like in some countries india nepal bangladesh to name a few partly because most of these perpetrators are greedy opportunists who lack much foresight and partly becaus the agencies that we have to counter such crimmes are quite efficient and do not let such criminal blights to take root in the system xd xd xd most of the crimes that occur are to do with some form of violence the bhutanese are quite hot headed at times specially those from the west and alcohol flows quite freely in our veins or petty thievery violence against women is an issue specially in the rural areas and things do seems to be getting better but there is still a lot left to do as for the lgbtq there are only a handful of them and there is not much discrimination against them sure they will raise a few eyebrows wherever they go but this is because there are so few of them most stay somewhere near the capital where things are a bit westernizedglobalizedand with that comes the western liberal view of sexuality in short sexuality is not much of an issue with most bhutanese so we do not bother much with who does what with whom you may find murals of holy protective penises on walls but these murals have less of a sexual connotation and more of a symbolic onethere is also a bit of tantric influence herexd xd as for our monarchs we are very lucky to have them and i mean this honestly i do concede that it is not entirely untrue to say that there is a bit of propaganda in a very loose sense of that word to paint the royals in a good light but i think this is justifiable because firstly people on average are not very bright and often lack coherence look at the current state of most true democracies in the world if you do not believe me so in the long run they may lack forsight and often because a distruption to the flow of progress due to civil unrest you may argue that such disruptions due to civil unrest are not as bad as i believe them to be and are infact quite necessary this may be true for other countries but for a tiny country like bhutan lodged between two giant and sly nations any form of civil unrest must be avoided or properly diffused in order to protect our sovereignty so i believe a propaganda is required to unify the opinion of the masses on certain topics the intellectual minority that do exist here as they do elsewhere would i believe opt not to act greedily for their own benefit and harm the nation as they will be under scrutiny of the royal who have the support of the public the royals are not all powerful though they may have influence over the masses opinion on certain topics but the are limited in their power by the constitution the king may be the head of the state and decide who to grant citizenship to but the government both local and centralized are democratically elected and controlled most matters it is similar to what they have in uk but the people like the royals a bit more so they have more influences and our house of lords called the national council is not filled with aristocrats xd xd secondly i say that we are lucky to have such royals because that is true had they been the wrong sort of royals the public would not have liked them it does seem a bit sad to think that people in other countries who might have been so cheated by their own royals find it so difficult to believe in the existence of a genuinely good king who does care about his people and country the royals serve another purpose too they provide the masses with moral support specially in times of crisis such as this it is for these reasons that i feel the saccharine propaganda if you could even call it that of the royals is justified looking at the state that our country is in currently compared to our neighbours who are in quite a pinch due to the ongoing pandemic i think you will find that the public is not wrong to appreciate such royalsxd xd as for racism yes it does exist here too like it does everywhere infact it is existence is expected given the faliablities of humanity and the presence of two clearly distinct ethnic groups the ethnic caucasoid and ethnic mongoloid with visibly but not symbolicmore on this later different religionculture but it is not currently doing the country much harm and efforts are being made to homogenized the two it is usually the rural areas wher most racist thoughts prevail since these communities are usually made up of people of a single ethnicity hence they are more prone to think in terms of us and them even within these two distinct groups there is a bit of discrimination based on class and caste but these issues stay within lounges over cups of tea or a glass of wine or around the fireplace after a good days work people do believe in stereotypes but this does not because anyone much trouble since publically acting out on these racist thoughts would bring the publics attention to the perpetrator and they will be punished for acting out this is because we bhutanese have a strong sense of morality when judging others or atleast some vocal bhutanese do and so racism is prevented from being institutionalized xd xd another aspect of bhutanese culture that might seem peculiar to others is how happy we claim we are it is true that bhutan is a peaceful country we are not at war with anyone people are well taken care of healthcare and education are free ahem ahem murica ahem these and a lot more are what you are general told but i would like to point out a few other reasons for our happiness firstly both the major religions that you may find in bhutan vajrayana buddhism and hinduism are rather philosophical in practice and their philosophy is one of nonviolence antimaterialism you will not find any hindu who follows the philosophy of lokayata here and one that is centred around finding hapiness not all bhutanese are religious but the moral values that these two religions emphasizes do seem to trickle down and take root in the minds of most bhutanese on this note the current king has taken initiatives to preserve both of these religions and he seems to be quite a devotee of shiva shaivism shares a lot of similarities in it is philosophy with the form of tantric buddhism practiced in bhutan another reason that the bhutanese are so happy is because of their simplicity in thought and their innocence sure there are a few sly foxes and snakes but they do not seem to be able to induce their shrewdness onto other bhutanese life is less stressful here so people have not the need to burn themselves down to the last shreads of humanity to struggle to deceive others for their survival some may find the bhutanese speech to be one that is quite slow this may be the product of a sedated life since life is quite stress free here compare to elsewhere but this is a generalisation and there will always be a few exceptions we are a merry lot because most of us have not seen the true depravity of humanity xd xd and the reason that you were taken outside the city centres might be because it is the agenda of the tourism board to mesmarize you with the beautiful landscapes and peculiar culture sure they could let you vist the cities if you could call them that but it is not there that we have the best to offer and there is also the danger of certain tourists spoiling the urban youths drugs sex tourism the like so one has to act cautiously besides that the tourism board might have wanted to be more hospitable and pamper you by relieving you of some of the decision and choosing things for you so that you could better enjoy the experience here you see a misunderstanding between two cultures on that note any sort of tourism would have to put up a faade an idea of what they are trying to sell reality is far to complex to fit into such neat descriptionsxd xd bhutan is not the happiest place i do not know how you would even measure happiness but the conditions that should keep a person happy are well fulfilled

not sure if you are being sarcastic or not that is accurate but it means that the ccp has to hold up its end of the bargain and keep the economic gravy train running a recession or even depression would be disastrous for them and probably for the rest of the world as well since they would have to scramble to find another uniting factor to maintain legitimacy that would likely be war,659.1446693971159,1495.8532720328806,9343.186236235306,14641.52977856951

they have a foreign policy of strategic depth meaning in a theoretical war with india they would have muslim allies in the north to allow them a whole country to retreat into if the indians push into pakin order to gain assurances for this they reciprocally offer the taliban strategic depth to rest and replenish inside pakistan against nato the afghan governmentthe problem is that a war with india has not materialised and pakistans reputation is circling the drain due to their proximity to groups like aq and the taliban they have lost a large amount of foreign aid and military training via the us and biden has not even picked up the phone to call the pakistani pm imran khan,1067.9211094739346,2734.5492327471147,10254.94928187774,12852.808910542608

well for one wikipedia does as do virtually all the neutral western historians noting that war they note china as the ultimate victor of the chinese civil war also the united nations kicked roc out a few years later and gave the seat to prc simplly because the roc lost their capital city in the mainland which under international laws meant they lost the war and no longer the dominant chinese political body though technically the civil war is legally ongoing as it never truly ended but china seems to be getting stronger and richer by they be the largest economy and their middle class is growing rapidly they are just waiting to build up modernise and expand their navies and economy so it would be easy for them in the future compared to their outdated naval equipment just a few decades ago httpswwwbusinesshsbccomnavigatormadeforchinasixthingsyoumaynotknowaboutchinesemillennials,1100.6642812179089,3818.3980249697656,17227.257744492374,25978.7757241462

on the picture it shows a who logo slapped onto the womans ass why is it so because people think who is distancing itself from usa and is allowing it to be taken advantaged no sexual connotation of by xjp or by extension the ccp the first question i would ask as an apolitical observer is why is it wrong for who to praise a country when they had the quickest and most efficient response thus far responding in days first case detected on december to nationwide response on january especially when it is the country where covid originated despite it not being transparent enough notably february and april which had a spike in daily infections and deaths respectively the who team who were permitted access into wuhan then the epicenter of the outbreak are westerners and the directorgeneral of who is ethiopian they are from capitalist anti communist nations thus pledging zero allegiance to china and have no reason to be accused as ccp shills or communist bootlickers proponents of the china wanted covid to spread to europe and america argument and the like ignore the fact that china alerted who on decemeber and china briefed usa japan and a few other countries cdcs on january about the mysterious virus and have announced that they have identified the new virus on january first making it public that a coronavirus epidemic is spreading in china in addition if we could pause and think for a moment why would china willingly allow the virus to spread when it is apparent to all that inaction would only hurt their economy and the economies of other countries globally slowing down trade further damaging chinas economy i feel that linking corporations organizations and people to ccp due to possible mistakes that were committed in the recent five years may not do justice for the good they may bring in my country we value free speech and we believe in viewing events objectively and not skewed according to our beliefs edit i did expect to be downvoted and indeed i was but do note that downvoting or upvoting do not make you more correct i am open to constructive feedback since i might have been influenced to a limited extent by externalities like the press however most of the online news articles are anticommunist and others once again i repeat the facts stated may sound probeijing but facts are facts and no one can change history so that is all i guess,1099.9324245501969,4882.969564500422,23966.22289386485,32518.13932773678

i tried to understand there might be a little bit of a language barrier i think the point you are trying to make is that china is painted in a bad light and it is not all true and many people live happily in china not enslaved and live their lives fine my only thing is that china has been an authoritarian country for thousands of years even before communism china was always based on hierarchy and a monarchy therefore chinse culture has always lent itself to being a very orderly society that responds well to very strong government intervention and control the thing is i do not care what the media says about china i see what they are doing and make my own decisions based on it i live in the united states and i also disagree with many things going on in this country as well but many people disagree and we are marching in our streets demanding change and we are getting change and next year we can even have a different president to help foster than change even further go and disagree with your government and see what happens,586.6083328689093,1850.244663147245,12740.689588229818,23103.607756574293

furthermore man every person in china who believes in any political or religious system not permitted by the ccp is an enemy of the state they are being held hostage in china because of visa restrictions free will does not exist in china without consequence for when your wi deviates from the ccps stance on what you are able to do with your will ie free to a degree so yes i think if he spoke out in support of hk he could be detained for sedition crimes and is therefore in some way a hostage and no he is not being forced to say all of this it is simply a fact that if he does not take a neutral perspective then there is a strong chance that china may force him through threat of legal consequence to echo the chinese perspective and thereby continue to be able to work in china if you say or do anything against the ccp as a visitor you will not be allowed back lebron is protecting his job it does not make him a shill it makes him a man trying to stay out of jail personally though i think lebrons permitting the triumph of evil by saying nothing all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing edmund burke,695.8182240493945,2055.36495930441,12745.064745103316,22685.070125364506

because the country is pretty mixed most of afghanistans provinces have large number of ethnic minorities even if they have a finance ethnic group additionally inter ethnic marriages are common in many urban and mixed areasyou also have a lot of say pashtun tribes in the north who are fully persianised while at the same time you have a lot of tajik groups in pashtun areas that are fully pashtunised furthermore you have urban and rural difference your average pashtun tajik uzbek hazara peasant from the valleys and mountain regions of afghanistan as more in common with each other than the urban populations of big cities afghans hate to admit it but have far more in common with each other than they have differencesadditionally no proper census has been conducted to know what the actual ethnic break down of the county even then it be difficult because a lot of people do not even knowtheir own ethnic backgrounds oh and the country being patriarchal means that you could have a tajik father and a turkmen mother but you will be classed as a tajik and the same is true of you have pashtun father and uzbek mother or a hazara with a pashtun mother,1113.6932060085494,3119.6497895356138,16810.716241657014,26082.078402594172

there are things i am going to that make the biggest difference compared to the s the biggest is the internet and cell phonesallowing for communication and instant notification of things happening hell even people in the mountains have cell phones although its more likely that people in the cities will have much better access to information you give people the ability to communicate instantly organize and coordinate you got the potential for people to rise up that was nonexistent in the s and it was much easier for groups like the taliban to control the flow of information to the people for people born in living that western style life even if it was in a basic formis still a huge leap the soviets were there for yrs but when the soviets took over they did not implement a western lifestyle or norms soviets were in a way just a different flavor of talibana hardline totalitarian regime who answered to only oneman rulegetting a yr old to go from a western freedom lifestyle to a th century dear leader lifestyle will not happen sure fear and intimidation will suppress some but not all especially if they have the ability to communicate with one another,857.4548830973786,2934.284819614165,16001.914599847487,26914.893029454935

mmm that is not the definition i have of terrorism i do not see the point of instilling terror in civilians in fact terrorism is more about premeditated political homicides sabotage with the aim of destabilising politically and most importantly instilling terror in leaders political officials until you win your terror war terrorism is just a form of war of a faction against another a faction who needs to obtain authority to change the system because there is a need to against a faction who formally and legally already has authority over the population if you know the history of the old man of alamut and the hashashinsfedayeen that was the precursor of terrorism and a man who should be respected to the level of personalities like napoleon and caesarthe logic of terrorism is instead of fighting a long front war which is like attacking the body of a bull you can direct your attacks to the brains and other critical personalities like stroking a blow at the bulls headedit his way of winning wars in that sneaky subversive manner was also inspiration for military secret services espionage and infiltration in fact i call him the ancient forefather of military intelligence,1137.233029703526,4824.618604184269,21610.554775359993,29052.893735091784

i do not buy the whole lifted out of poverty narrative at least not to the scale that is claimed by the ccp it is bullshit just like all of their numbers the international standard for extreme poverty is living on less than day if someone is now getting day they are no longer considered impoverished are they the new standard according to the world bank for people in developing countries is day by the way are we to believe that without the ccp chinese peasants would still be living in that progress and improvement was only possible because of the ccp despite the welldocumented cases of the ccp massively fucking everything up do you think that without the great famine the great leap forward the cultural revolution that the chinese people would be worse off or better sure things have gotten better for the average zhou that is called progress and is pretty much inevitable unless you have a murderous dictator leading your country for decades the ccp just has not been actively trying to fuck up the economy since deng took over that is all although honestly with the property bubble and a move from a manufacturing economy i am not sure if there are not going to be some serious economic troubles in china pretty soon and do you know who is going to suffer when those economic troubles happen not the greedy corrupt ccp who have already purchased homes in canada and australia for their families and mistresses to prepare for the inevitable,672.709923867117,2312.381639687034,14250.268074668767,25813.405988251532

i do not need to google when the bbfc publish the rules freely in their website it is just not true you can read their own report they publish one every years and adjust things if they are not working out i studied media i had talkslectures by the bbfc this whole rumour started recently but it is never been the bbfc guidelines why do not you google the guidelines for yourself and stop reading them rd hand the bbfc are transparent industry body they publish everything they review on their website they explain what was cut and why it was cut it is not that i have not heard of it because it was cut it just does not actually happen the bbfc are also independent with the government by framing the argument by being about porn etc rather than the fact that it is completely fucking impossible for the bbfc to accomplish this and what will that end up actually meaning will happen which is the real scary thing here it makes me wonder why the independent and the guardian keep making this argument the problem here is that this type of law will only lead to the government going the bbfc can not do its job so we have to take over because it can barely handle things as is the bbfc has strongly resisted control by the government in the past and has repeatedly said it does not want to make its restrictions any stronger the government want control of this and i feel like this is a way to stir hate against the bbfc so the government can take full control of what they do they cut barely anything ever seriously it has to be pretty bad to get cut and there is no such thing as a four finger rule because each video has to be reviewed by an actual person all the way through and they make a judgement most of theses guys days are watching porn i wanted to work for the bbfc once so i know a bit about it i am completely against this law that the independent is talking about but it is hard to defend them when they are outright lying and twisting the truth like they are in that article,636.2243549016958,2414.5486559339965,15011.762118008344,27315.932593052898

of course people will talk according to their ideological leaningsbiases the truth is that no faction blue or green is eager to tip the scales of the statusquo balance right now even the ostensibly more proroc blue faction is okay with maintaining that stance while continuing to enjoy having a chance every four years to rule taiwan a chance that it definitely will not get either under ccp rule or under some hypothetical francestyle reunified china where the provincial level receives relatively little autonomy also even hardcore prounification blues do not equal ccp sympathizers that is a very blackandwhite absolutist and dualistic the only split is between pro and antireunification way of looking at the world like i said before blues who focus on taiwan want themselves to be the ones in charge blues who focus on some fanciful reconquista of the mainland also want themselves to be in charge of this newly liberated china either way the history and ideologies of the blues ie nationalist party versus the ccp are too fraught for any true blue to want the ccp to be involved in any of their reunification plans,1525.045232547506,5164.770201361574,20490.60018297094,26660.941397588165

this may be true but online shouting matches typically result in censorship too i have seen dozens of posts on places like rnews where the majority sensationalized opinion crushed out the minority rational one which later turned out to be factual in some ways this site tends to censor any prochina opinions and i am really pretty anticcp but like every regime it has some things that it does quite well and this particular regime is actually exceptionally and surprisingly good at certain things that do objectively help and benefit millions of people though you would never know that going to a page like this there really is a place for exactly what you are talking about expressing anger in the hopes of creating change and goodness knows china deserves that in whatever way will effect change most quickly but the ccp does not care how angry a bunch of expats or even people who have never been to china are us crying unfair is simply not going to change anything so to my thinking i would prefer a place where people who have been in china longer than i have can discuss and share opinions that we can all assess critically i would much rather be challenged by someone who i think is wrong than to have my opinion reinforced by someone ranting the same thoughts i already have,854.1041252664945,3397.353875090271,18457.945773120256,27824.7550143217

so i am not bhutanese so this may have holes that i would welcome other people to fill in i studied abroad in bhutan and also lived in an area of the us with a large bhutanese refugee populationxd xd in the early s i think unrest in nepal led to many refugees fleeing and settling in bhutan eventually integrating into communities they were bhutanese most only spoke dzongkha and sometimes english like most bhutanese but kept many of their cultural and religious customs from nepal where hindu and buddhism blend for most families this included cultural dress and religious holidaysxd xd in the nineties as bhutan began to modernize and step into the global stage government became increasingly concerned about their national identity their relationship to china has obviously been contentious since the tibetan genocide and other small countries in the region like sikkim nepal are in cycles of unrest or in sikkims case annexed bhutans perspective was that preservation of a firm consistent and unique national identity would bolster their value on the worlds stage and prevent overthrow invasion etc among the laws they passed to ensure this were things like the national dress law which required bhutanese to wear traditional clothing in lots of different contextsi think at school and work and on holidays especially but also it might still be a law that any piece of media that gets internationally distributed that depicts bhutanese life requires all participants to be in national dressxd xd this conflicted with the religious and cultural customs of the oncenepalese population in the south of bhutan and things became very contentious very quickly anecdotally there were horrific atrocities taking placebeheadings and murders of activists and brutal responses to the nonbhutanese cultural dress beyond the earth and sky by jaime zappa goes into it a little bitshe was in the country for some of the activity the somewhat tepid reasoning i was given when gently asking about thisnot while i was in the countrywas that the bhutanese government did not want nepal to be able to make a cultural claim to bhutanese soil as india did to sikkim go figure they failed to mention that sikkim went through a whole overviewit was presented to me as they were absorbed for failure to have a national identity distinct from india which is not quite true xd xd the bloodiness of this conflict almost entirely perpetrated on the nepalese descended bhutanese escalated attracted some attention on the world stage and the government cut their losses and expelled every last one from the country people who had lived almost a hundred years peacefully alongside ethnic bhutanese who knew of no other home were forced out many settled in cleveland where i lived a while and are still struggling immensely to find financial support integrate and understand american customs and english etc their communities are wracked with poverty and obviously the terror and violence they endured before being expelled from bhutan is still very much living memoryxd xd i loved my time in bhutan and i think it is a marvelous countrycertainly as an american i can not throw stones but it would be a mistake to award the minister who made most of the decisions and perpetuated this violenceessentially erasing an entire hybrid culture and a chapter of bhutanese historywith any sort of esteem in time i truly hope bhutans position on all of this will become apologetic and with an eye toward reparationsthe bhutanese diaspora still needs them they certainly have a different rhetorical approach to tibetan refugees i have hope but not when the country allows this event to be glorifiedxd xd edit did some reading that might help your googling the expelled group are called the lhotshampa and their exile took place from the late eighties to something like were forced out which is like a sixth or a seventh of bhutans total population i was also wrong above many of the lhotshampa knew no dzongkha only nepali and english and one measure the government took was to remove nepali as a language of instruction,1458.146863562465,5885.854757007049,24725.344757515053,32785.84555205857

to reiterate you think there is nothing wrong with two adult authority figures shaming a child into hating her own name that her parents chose for her with a beautiful meaning behind it because it may sound like a bad word in mandarin and in the future ethnic minority people should choose names based not on what those names mean within the context of their own culture but based on how they sound to mandarin speakers thus placing the onus of ethnic minorities to conform to han standards rather than for han chinese to become more openminded toward other cultures and the different sounds of their languages oh and punishing kids with threats of verbal abuse and corporal punishment for speaking their native language amongst peers of their own culture in their own native lands is okay because there is no other possible way to promote a national language than to drive the native language into irrelevancy by force,1246.0396160300975,4455.709093652816,18409.781758639823,26351.859778784856

good points although i do not understand your point about geopolitics not being viable or relevant to uschina relations perhaps elaborate on that maybe your point is that geopolitics is not everything and there are major ideological factors and other nonzero sum factors like economics yes yes and yes but those three things ideology geopolitics and economics are not always in harmony china represents a case where you can be rich or free in your relationship with them pick one you can be rich and submit to the communist party or you can make money elsewhere and be free as an american my nature is to be free or die but i think everyone feels the same the chinese people themselves are essentially hostage to a totalitarian police state the previous video link i sent was a lecture here is a debate instead httpsyoutubeorltvbnxhq in the debate you hear a clear ultimatum for australia but again it is applicable to every country in the world either get rich with china and submit to their domination or be free but one other thing to consider the us is the global hegemon and it will not back down from china so if you pick money over geopolitical liberty then you will be an enemy of the us the choice is yours i highly recommend that debate speaking of the money yes china is large and you can make money there india is large too south america is large africa is large we do not need cheap labor from china in order to have a first world society we need to shift industry from the totalitarian communist police state that wants to dominate the world in its image or suffer the consequences it is that simple and to our earlier conversation obama dropped the ball no democratic candidate is even aware of the problem with front runner biden literally copacetic with our current relationship with china httpswwwgooglecomampsampscmpcomnewsworldunitedstatescanadaarticlechinagoingeatourlunchjoebidendismisses i voted for obama twice then i voted for trump twice soon because of china china china if you want to know just how pervasive china is in the us i highly recommend this the story of the same in every country we need to wake up httpsyoutubeohkadnik httpsyoutubeqxqhebdm httpsyoutubegutkebgek regarding europe europe has been a bad ally to the united states regarding china russia nato and trade not only does the us essentially subsidize european security but in return europe wages trade war against the us everyday sort of like china but not as bad or illegal but europes state industrialization policy has crushed lots of industry in the us while taking advantage of us openness all the while failing to meet nato requirements failing to address russia in ukraine or elsewhere even failing to prevent genocide in their own backyard in bosnia for some reason the us had to do that too the notion that the us is the bad guy for just barely reciprocating some trade protectionism is ridiculous right now europe is basically a protectorate of the us we do not want that we want allies we protect germany from russia while they wage state industrial policy against us and while they increase their reliance on russian gas we protect eu from china while it buys chinese g technology i think it plainly true that the us has been badly taken advantage of by europe in the ways that trump points out as for the ideological battle is china better or western enlightenment with freedom i can not believe such a topic is even considered which sadly it is too often first of all if getting rich is so important and you are willing to subjugate yourself to a police state and dictatorship then be my guest but if you want to get rich and be free guess what the us is the richest country in the world every country that has adopted enlightenment values is also rich and free and flourishing china got rich by stealing technology stealing industry utilizing slave labor destroying its environment and using its citizens like little pawns is that what you want compare china to hong kong same people different politics system people vote with their feet which side of the border has walls in addition china can not get rich by stealing forever eventually they have to innovate but we can innovate better fuck their bootleg gucci and fake apple stores it is disgraceful to consider the chinese ideology a good one for the human race,935.0027821857434,3618.7805733328446,19188.715806119842,31930.648520729443

i will try to make it short the so called refugees were nepalese who fled nepal due to the political instability occurring in the country at the time or simply wanted to move to another nation bhutan india so on when they arrived in bhutan they were allowed to do so provided they abide by the local laws traditions however the geo political climate at the time saw many tibetanburman kingdoms falling to either india ladakh sikkim or to china tibet sikkim in particular is an important case as the royal families of sikkim bhutan are cousins as part of indias strategy to annex sikkim a large percentage of nepalese indians who having settled in the country removed the chogyal of sikkim the royal family from power the native sikkimese were reduced to becoming a minority in their own nation bhutan having witnessed this refused to suffer the same fate the royal govt of bhutan came up with the plan to unify its people so that no foreign agent could ever topple bhutan unfortunately the nepalese did not see that way despite being reassured that it would not take away their cultural heritage or identity some possibly more of the nepalese incited doubt fear among their countrymen which resulted in nepalese asking for a new land within bhutan just as bhutan feared any nepalese who refused to go along with this madness were deemed as traitors by other nepalese killed or harmed while it is true that bhutan did resort to using armed forces to quell the problem this was only done after failing to come to a peaceful solution with the nepalese there were strict orders to not harm the nepalese after all some of them held high posts in royal govt when all else failed majority of the nepalese decided not expelled to get out of bhutan despite pleas from the nation not to do so those who remained became the current lhotshampas while it is true that bhutan could have handled things in a better way the nepalese gave little choice to for a proper solution these refugees like telling outsiders their sob story but they always conveniently omitt having their hand in causing their own problems or the real reason of leaving bhutan the lhotshampas living in bhutan are given equal opportunity treatment as any other bhutanese ethnic group and for those wondering lhotshampas is the correct political term for bhutanese citizens of nepalese heritage the so called refugees are nepalese plain simple being able to speak dzongkha does not make you a bhutanese otherwise anyone who can speak japanese or english is automatically by that logic a british or a japanese citizen,1283.6456730463487,5296.7885442365405,23026.53053372708,32083.906941588717

do not forget about the day to day thuggery for all their talk about islam at their heart the taliban have always had more in common with organized crime their big attraction was that for young men without much opportunity the taliban was a chance to get stuffthey could force people to hand over their daughters in order to provide their young men with wives most of the young men in the taliban were not good marriage prospects the only way they were ever going to get a woman was with a gun they could commit all manner of crimes ranging from rapes including children thefts murders and generally get away with it as long as their victims were not family members of other taliban which is why hazaras and other minority groups were frequently targeted when the world became aware of afghanistans problem with men preying on young boys it amazed me how nobody bothered to ask if the taliban perpetuated that,994.3830649584245,3466.168696913899,16958.78102034491,25508.212319957216

i personally believe that humans are naturally mostly good however hierarchy has a lot of inherent issues though in some situations of intense competition where efficiency is key it can be useful but ultimately hierarchy is problematic in that you are reliant on the hope that those in power are competent and have interests that align with those that are not in power sometimes this is true but if people that do not fullfill these criteria reach positions of power they can create a cycle where they create people that can not be trusted with power but that want power this is why in the long term hierarchy should be avoided it is not a complete dichotomy either but there is something to be said for the bare minimum of hierarchy as the ideal state of man,826.0169582362385,2851.61807699895,15147.860462247094,23521.106220387097

ok america literally did that wed go to villages and tell them if they support us and the afghan government we would protect them from retaliation they banked their safety on that by telling us when they saw taliban or showing us where bombs are now they are going to pay for that we gave our word and its our responsibility to live up to that maybe it does not mean yes troops on patrol in fact we have not been doing that for a few years but it does mean making sure the afghan government has support to take care of the taliban,540.3749706020716,2055.7950578890523,13667.612117576977,23072.139231059973

on a side note i believe i have seen at least some versions of it it essentially defends capitialism to develop to get to a stage so communism is viable yes this is a strategy similar to the ussrs nep but conducted on a longer and more total scale it is based in marx and engels writings on a historical materialist and economic determinist progression of human history i have some writings on this that you may find interesting i will copy the comment below in a moment orthodox marxism and china orthodox marxists and some mls marxismleninism is after all derived from orthodox marxism hold a view of marxs economic determinism and historical materialism where the capitalist mode of production performs a necessary historic role the capitalist mode of production is necessary to break the feudalistic mode of production to turn petty industry into the foundry the factory and the power plant individual production into petty socialized production individual labor being no longer sufficient for the production of goods production is now pursued as a social effort of many people in coordination and production is no longer done for subsistence but instead produces excess intended for distribution and trade to the whole of society the capitalist mode of production is both a socializing production that introduces class antagonisms and a stochastic process of progressive economic upheaval from feudalistic productive relations before capitalist production ie in the middle ages the system of petty industry obtained generally based upon the private property of the laborers in their means of production in the country the agriculture of the small peasant freeman or serf in the towns the handicrafts organized in guilds the instruments of labor land agricultural implements the workshop the tool were the instruments of labor of single individuals adapted for the use of one worker and therefore of necessity small dwarfish circumscribed but for this very reason they belonged as a rule to the producer himself to concentrate these scattered limited means of production to enlarge them to turn them into the powerful levers of production of the present day this was precisely the historic role of capitalist production and of its upholder the bourgeoisie engels socialism utopian and scientific this section of the text is a synopsis of the fourth section of capital the historic role of capitalist production is such that socialism can only be built from the capitalist society it originated from socialism requires capital to have been enlarged to the point of forming and requiring socialized production to function china is pursuing a socially directed capitalist development capitalism run by a revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat only time can tell if they will be able or willing to make the revolutionary departure from a developed capitalist society to an economically developed nation in the lower stages of a socialist society china had to move from a colonized feudalistic society broken apart into separate territories run by foreign nations and domestic warlordism into a world power even now chinas productive forces are behind that of other developed nations where it is the most populous country on earth yet runs an economy that is comparable to that of a population less than a quarter of its own in this manner they have to some degree argued that a limited national bourgeoise you can even see the origination of this strategy in on the question of the national bourgeoisie mao zedonghttpswwwmarxistsorgreferencearchivemaoselectedworksvolumemswvhtm serves a similarly counterimperialist economic function as nationalism serves as a social function in the struggle for material liberation from a colonized society the chinese system is not incompatible with marxism nor does it refute or reject it instead it has embraced an approach of stagism after all it is marx who viewed full maturation of capitalism as the precondition for socialist realization eighth national congress of the communist party of chinahttpswwwmarxistsorgsubjectchinadocumentscpcthcongresshtm this report talks about a necessary and complicated alliance with the national bourgeoisie against foreign imperial forces and the class struggle and restrictions that will take place against the bourgeoisie as they attempt to further implement capitalism the cpc at this time wanted to implement state capitalism similar to the ussrs new economic policy in order to gain the support of the national bourgeoisie and make use of them economically while enforcing state control over private industry and simultaneously persuading and reeducating them throughout the gradual transition to socialism the report also covers the want for implementing peaceful international relations with every country including the usa and the need to be vigilant in the face of imperialist hostility while doing so peaceful rise type stuff the congress argues for this because they recognize the primary contradiction within postrevolution china as the condition of the country backwards productive forces vs the peoples increasing material and cultural needs deng was not making things up out of nowhere when he referenced the same things to advance reform these were party thoughts under mao the difference is that mao moved beyond them the congress predicted it would take three year plans or a little longer to industrialize and one or two year plans to transition to socialism indeed under mao enormous strides were made in transforming the country from its wartorn state into an industrialized egalitarian socialist powerhouse here lies the break overlypragmatic deng and other roaders did not think that china had made enough use of the capitalists yet because everyone was equally poor and further benefits could be squeezed out of a capitalistalliance before transitioning to socialism undoubtedly there was an external influence from other countries including the asian tigers such as lee kuan yew mao obviously disagreed and launched the gpcr to root out and stop revisionists like deng but to his disappointment more workers defended their superiors than did bombard them and broadly speaking the gpcr did not accomplish its goals third plenary session of the eleventh central committeehttpwwwbjreviewcomnationtxtcontenthtm here this report on a plenary session taking place soon after maos death returns to the conclusions made by the th national congress to shift the emphasis back to socialist modernization and generally advocating for a more practicebased approach for developing under changing historical conditions clearly from the th national congress we can see

dude i am russian and i can smell propaganda and bs from miles away because russia was an expert in propaganda and loved to engage in it as someone actually russian unlike you i have learned to recognize how propaganda works because americans or people who buy into american soft power think they are democratic and their mediagovernment respects human rights whatever that means a view still surprisingly held by surprisingly many people they have difficulty seeing american propaganda in respect to other countries for example the narrative on russia has recently shifted rapidly from people viewing russia as an adversary to more of a friend expect to see the allegations of russian cheating in the olympics to be withdrawn or toned down in the coming months and china from going neutral to enemy from what i can see america is currently upping antichinese rhetoric as it has done with russiaussr on numerous occassions to distract from its failures to handle the coronavirus epidemic despite having months of forewarning especially going into election season furthermore you are buying into american soft power by using their own terms what do you mean you may ask what i mean is that the terms you use freedom of speech democracy etc are all political slogans that where frequently used in the ussr and continue to be used in russia these slogans are meant to instill a certain point of view but they work particularly well in america because it sells the view of free and fair unbiased media however this is far from the truth i suggest you read manufactering consent by noam chomsky i can link you a free version of it if you lack money to purchase it as it explains in depth how the american propaganda method works it also seems that despite the ccps faults they are mostly truthful why because they view themselves as being in an inferior position and because they know they lack soft power so if they were caught in lies would mean reputational damage the us also understands this and that is why it tries to blow things out of proportion and damage chinas reputation,1104.4870549551072,4351.327606108102,21636.463105298033,31291.97207479015

the twitter he sent is the slogan of people who want hk to be independent that is the problem the hk government should simply take steps to provide what china promised it would provide true autonomy until it is true that some hkers are seeking independence but hkers do not agree on everything if hk gets what china promised which is one country with two truly different systems hkers would stand down the hk gov should provide the remaining demands i believe this is what daryl morey meant also plz tell me what did chinese government do to hk the chinese government has injected itself into hk politics in order to seize control over its people before which is when beijing is expected to take full control if you think his comments did not hateful then why so many chinese are angry with him if you are chinese you can probably answer that more accurately than i can the impression i have is that the chinese people who have responded with anger feel that their pride and respect has been questioned is that evidence that their pride and respect has been questioned i do not think so they are not accustomed to criticisms of government and many have chosen to react by feeling insulted the fact that they have chosen to react that way is not evidence in itself that it is correct imagine you enter a restaurant and the greeter says people like you should sit over here she points out another room this is a decision point you have to decide to feel insulted or feel complimented either choice is a mistake without more information,767.2910333938485,3081.2084795642645,17212.624925162734,26460.97960046392

once again you did not understand the purpose behind my comments the point is the map and the people behind making it have classified an area which like goa was governed by the portuguese and unlike goa was negotiated and peacefully handed over as occupied since their threshold for what occupation is also covers peaceful handovers of portuguese colonies it becomes quite clear that by such definition indian hold over goa would also clearly be classified as occupation indians did what was necessary to unify the scattered princely states and form a united and democratic india as well as the princely territories by their own definition the princely states also should be classified as occupied the term occupation is oblivious to the political structure of a country you do not stop occupying territories just because the political structure of the polity in question purportedly is elected by votes israel does not stop from occupying territories because it is democratic they too say they do what is necessary to further their own goals hence my original comment under this maps criteria for occupation significant tracts of india would be occupied it is just that the goamacau comparison is the most clear example of the cognitivedissonance of the maps criteria,1302.819865388028,5295.22520171595,21356.75392066944,28109.204679823757

i do believe that these are uighurs and that there are definitely uighurs who are unfairly caught up in the reeducation centers if they are all uighurs and they are all blindfolded with shaved heads that is already pretty damn wrong as it is if it is just prisoners then there should be han chinese in with them and i do not think there is ever a need to blindfold prisoners the fact they are separating uighurs out is enough evidence that they are getting very different treatment to normal han chinese prisonersotherwise why do it,575.2024275714432,1392.2213039207652,8396.293998296334,14876.387373972666

it is whataboutism and not even a good one china is performing genocide now is not countered by america performed genocide in the past every country on earth has skeletons literally in their closet that does not mean we should not try to be better now as far as migrant camps go first as horrible as they were they are not even close to the same in terms of treatment or number of people second half the country was absolutely livid about those camps and the reports coming out of there and we removed the administration that was responsible for them third even though government in the states works slowly and there are a ton of messes to clean up and even though most of the new people who are being housed in the camps now are unattended minors andor people being quarantined due to covid rules and even though biden signed in his first week in office an executive order mandating s comprehensive review of the policies surrounding the campsa fair portion of the democratic voter base is still actively angry and advocating for more to be done to close those camps and make amends measurable progress is being made and that is still not enough for a lot of americans compare that to china where not only is no progress being made but most citizens are apparently supportive of the governments policies with regards to the uyghers they do not even recognize it as a problem to be solved so honestly how dare you try to compare these two incidents america is by no means perfect we have issues with police violence and discrimination all over but a big part of why those issues are so obvious is because we talk about them we have press that is free to report on them and we as citizens can vociferously attack our government for not doing better none of that is true in china the fact that the few leaks that are getting out paint the situation so badly means that if the government allowed free speech the way america does there would be no possible comparison between china and the migrant camps,750.3039396488774,2628.8297584514826,17137.071865193415,29385.608981125522

bottom line this began when trump struck a deal with the taliban and was actually pushing to have all troops out at the end of last year i do not fault trump or biden the government of afghanistan and the leaders of their security forces were apparently so soft and orcorrupt they were unwilling to put up any resistance that could have permitted thousands of their fellow countrymen to leave was this an unmitigated disaster you betcha a bitter pill to swallow most definitely is we were supporting corrupt and incapable officials that were apparently unwillingunable to fight for their fellow countrymen i am furious just a few days of fighting could have saved thousands trying to leave we either should have left long ago or shitcanned the entire government and rebuilt it all from scratch,1075.4855799861862,3941.760260055172,16642.540611841894,23833.37838019629
i was a little skeptic of this policy but now that i think about it this seems fair to me a little regressive but fair i think the idea is to protect the identity and sovereignty of the country it might be an unpopular take but i think the government is just trying their best to avoid any future incidences like the s problem xd xd and this is from it just says these laws were put in place in s,478.0768842918655,1505.5170055617602,11052.004727546442,18766.01513478771

i think we are missing each other i am all for everyone who has experience with china doing a good job of reflecting their values and knowledge in how they vote and using that platform to express their outrage about the legitimate and numerous infractions that the ccp has committed and i think we also need to use our knowledge of china to educate people who have less interaction or knowledge about what goes on there and i am not trying to say that this should be a sub for chinese people obviously their own government has deliberately cut their own people off from having that platform and while i am always happy to engage with nonwumao mainlanders in the sub i recognize that it is not likely that they are going to come on here and talk about stuff from their own country as much as you and i might in a sub about america what i am trying to say is that i think it is unfortunately common that stuff devolves into a hate circlejerk here that i care about the good the bad and the ugly about china both because i want to be genuinely informed about all of those aspects in part because it affects my life as someone who lives in china and because i think it is important for the message that gets out to other people to be equally fair to me at least it damages the credibility of this sub at times with how negative the general bent of it is it would be a bit easier for me to believe some of the negative parts if i had the impression that people on this sub were interested in viewing china for everything it is good and bad,502.6589858524299,1619.8772741039702,13239.669795559817,25485.287788976748

yes ancient chinese kingdoms definitely supported free speech and you could insult the emperors without any repurcussions well such thing actually exists the httpszhwikipediaorgzhcneaeae was systematically designed in courts to refute and deny the emperor and the maximum punishment an emperor can give was spanking them but not killing them the best part the job was paid by the state and officials was very proud that him disagrees with the emperor in public and most of the time walks free it is not exactly free speech but there is that however it became tournament for disagreement just for the sake of it later and was heavily gamed by trolls to gain political fame it kind of like what happened to ask prime minister,1125.3811352815133,4707.691903410524,19081.820995006834,25396.846024155016

there is no way germany would go to war with both russia and france at once that is madness they would be throwing away decades of progress and prosperity said the world in the years before there is no way japan would attack the united states and try to conquer half the planet when they are already struggling to conquer china said everyone in the world before chinas strategic outlook is strikingly similar to that of germany before wwi and japan before wwii that of a power that has experienced a period of rapid growth that is suddenly faltering while the worlds other major powers slowly draw together in a coalition to oppose them an accelerating arms race with the worlds preeminent naval power even the dependency on foreign fuel and raw material imports all of these are serious war flags for an ambitious power like china we must also not forget that china is not a rational actor in the first place it is an autocratic oneparty state meaning the ccp cares nothing for the prosperity of china except insofar as it keeps them in power and would as soon squash it as build it if they felt it in their interest this is essentially what is happening under xi jinping already squashing the hightech sector under the guise of anticorruption is their means of reexerting party control back over the economy in the second place xi jinping himself is not a rational actor either by all accounts he is an insecure micromanager who isolates himself in paranoia and treats his ministers like an emperor rather than a normal boss a situation not conducive to receiving bad news or criticism indeed zero covid went on the way it did mostly because xi insisted personally that it should notably in his abrupt aboutface crackdown on shanghai last spring taken all together the risk of china doing something drastic like pearlharboring okinawa before their longsought strategic goals fly out of reach forever and japan and the us are fully ready to oppose them is far far higher than most people appreciate and to be clear the us and japan are dead serious about preventing an invasion of taiwan by force of arms this is not sabrerattling by politicians but the primary concern for military planners in both the us armed forces and jsdf moreover unlike in the cold war the threat of massive conventional response across the plains of europe is no longer there the only real risk being that of a limited and mostly naval war meaning all parties involved feel less risk involved in going to war while the economic interdependence that many people feel should make war less likely paradoxically make it more likely because it make the leaders of all nations involved feel insecure in ways that they would not were they more economically independent from one another as the two blocs of the cold war were,1250.0404503112918,4738.89276824989,22272.87717500385,31515.46327972625

thank you for clarifying that we disagree on stuff but it is not personal i appreciate the objectivity but first you concentrate way to hard on the word geopolitic and i do not think this is a good thing because geopolitic is about balance and carefully weighting of interest and it legitimises every interest at play which is not really viable when dealing with the current china i mean do one consider china to be just another player with its own citizen to feed and economy to grow then it is questionable how much can be done on the line of you are either with us or against us since for everyone involved the objective is mainly to maximize profits and that can not normally happen by antagonizing any big economy but if you see china as an ideological enemy because of its increasing authoritarian tendency which i think one should there is the problem of what each side represents china is pushing hard for the legitimacy of an ethno state which unites it is people with nationalism and economic protectionism and their argument is that this model gets shit done i mean when the new headquarters of the african union is build by an chinese company it tends to impress people and you think trump can counter this push for nationalism and economic protectionism or does he rather legitimise this model of ideology which by the way the other economic center of the world besides china and the us really tries to fend off i am speaking of the eu sure the european countries also happens to have a surge in protectionist and nationalist parties but the consensus is to stick with the nonisolationist way but when trump is just slapping tarifs to protect its own economy instead of promote trade and cooperation the eu is forced to do more trade with china and the rest of the world this is what i mean most by blowing up the classic alliances nessecary to deter china i mean be honest do you really think thailand vietnam and cambodia are enough to contain china it is about economic interest and for that you guys will need the eu so what is it really ideological division or geopolitical powerplay,817.0008302127811,3261.5373728216846,17914.200293329282,28752.99529689415

no because then this becomes about playing a game of semantics which is what these propaganda entities are trying to do in the first place and it drags legitimate news broadcasters like the bbc and al jazeera down to the level of propaganda agents like xinhua simultaneously you can also say it elevates the level of these propaganda agents to the same realm as a proper news broadcaster this is not about political correctness or claims of bias the distinction between state funded vs actual propaganda are two different things regardless of what words used to describe it and no the viewer can not decide for himself again this is a very same argument made by chinese propaganda we will tell you our version of events in xinjiang and then you can decide for yourself this is literally the whole purpose of propaganda it is not about telling the news biased or not it is about deliberate disinformation,820.6764485613033,2962.7369301718722,15301.038562320891,25786.358452333963
while it is true that the kmt military forces fought many conventional battles it is wrong that the pla had only a small part in the war against japan not only did they participate in some armed forces in normal battles but also and much more important they waged sucessful guerilla warfare operations like the hundred regiment operation we can argue over the quality of their weaponry but the manpower of the kmt forces in was still overwhelmingly also because stalin did not had an interest in a strong and united china he funded both sides in the civil war about the popularity question the vast majority of chinese people in this era were tenant farmers only a small percentage of people lived in the big cities the situation during the civil war is quite comparable with the situation during the russian revolution in the peasants did not saw any change after the abolishment of tsarist rule and followed the only party that promised to release them from debt and serfdom the same thing basically happened in china after the end of the qing rule the farmers still were extremely poor and practically serfs of their landlords it was only logical to follow the side that burned certificates of debts and expropriated landlords i am not saying that the kmt was not popular in the cities the of the population that was eligible to vote were almost completly living in big cities like shanghai but it is obvious that they were only a small part of the populance,916.3829012224822,3164.067946679845,18557.172190167537,27886.803579596464

i am not an active reddit user just lurk in communities to see how things are going on online this is an account that i created today to post just thisis there a way for afghan diaspora and afghan people with influence to form a online group and actively point out the taliban sympathizers i know you are talking exclusively about west or more particularly usa but the taliban is getting sympathizers from all over the world people who hate usa are trying to propagate the message that afghan people have taken back their land and this is taliban so a chance needs to be givenpublic shaming is working better than actual judiciary system right now so please consider this option i am saying this because taliban and their cruelties are being normalized right now one of my countries opposition leader was actually angry with our govt for not starting talks with taliban in when he first suggested i did not know it was ok to say that taliban is a group that needs to be treated equally to legitimate govt this is something is only afghanistan people can do,695.6940740258967,2712.9511507913276,16428.58667951619,25882.609906983333

yes but i was using a hypothetical scenario ie imagine if the alt right was a unitary force and controlled everything centrally and you have some idea of the situation in china there is a liberalcosmopolitan bias amongst tech companies and in the arts and academia for various reasons this is true enough but it is really nothing comparable to the centralised chinese party state the power of big tech companies is a serious issue and a threat to democracy but i think that is a seperate issue,772.8966447163626,2178.2241011331166,11642.447636225308,21810.389074600007

my interpretations please do not take this as fact chinese people value money more than anything else being superficial is not frowned upon your value as a man is mostly based on your ability to support a family and therefore the amount of money you are able to make there is little emphasis on characteristics like empathy especially if they are not measurable even beauty is boiled down to a quantifiable characteristics like specific facial features although you will see this across east asia and sea to them bragging about how much money you have is kind of like how some guys in the west like to brag about their sex life asking your salary could be one of many things your value as a man your sincerity whether it is worth taking advantage of you and potential career paths they should consider,992.1564279548049,3192.5911812436134,15843.919116782232,25057.71016721503

it was donald trump that initiated talks with the taliban about troop withdrawal had he won he would still have withdrawn us troops and their allies would follow suit it was an election promise by both democrats and republicans what biden did very wrong is how he actually handled the withdrawal with citizens and vulnerable afghans who helped the troops left behind,1284.7046511186186,4952.2983690376905,16140.496958273685,17928.20225469807

i agree it is horrible and inhumane and the wes i do not care attitude is incredibly cruel please keep us in the loop i have one more question though can an eventual agreement between the taliban and masosudrabbanijamiatis work if massud et al are not allowed to keep their militias the agreement will not have any value because once they are disarmed the taliban pakistan will take over their territoryon the other hand letting them keep their militias would scare the taliban isi because it would mean having a big force of motivated soldiers just km from kabul also i can not imagine atta mohamed or particularly dostum not trying to get their share of the pie and well another questionis ismail khan doing anything in iran or have the iranians have told him to stay quiet and do not mess with herat and well another questionis ismail khan doing anything in iran or have the iranians have told him to stay quiet and do not mess with herat i know these are many questions but i have been interested in afghanistan since i have quite a few friends from there and it is a country that i feel very close to my heart thanks a lot,875.7479226556417,2525.8228608506,12567.87089502712,19036.015479844
there is something to that but for all its power remember that the supreme court can not just get together and enact whatever new laws strike their fancy that day they can only rule on whatever cases make their way to their bench which is only a very tiny fraction of cases where the constitutionality of something congress the president a governor state or local legislature did is challenged and even then they do not generally have the power to tell them what to do usually it is just a question of whether something they did is consistent with the constitution if it is not they can repeal it but that is it they can say no guys cut that out but they can not tell them what to do also nominees have to be approved by the senate and the senate does reject many of those nominees or often makes it known in advance that they will reject them so their nominations are withdrawn so if it is an important presidential power it should also be remembered that it is limited in many ways both structurally and practically and also once they are on the court many nominees adopt judging philosophies very different than the kind that led presidents to nominate them david souter for example was a bush nominee who became a staunch consistent liberal harry blackmun likewise was a nixon nominee who wrote the roe v wade decision was not a thing those presidents could do about it because they are lifetime appointees no takebacks so yes it is a big deal it is important but probably not as important as people sometimes make it out to be especially when you consider that the vast majority of cases that supreme court hears have nothing to do with big partisan ideological questions but usually more finegrained technical issues that is why it is not uncommon to find cases where say clarence thomas rules on the same side as ruth bader ginsburg,1085.0240654577578,3384.6020707670264,16297.62673729345,27849.296578524594

because it tends to be a true statement people point out the organ harvesting authoritarian government media censorship concentration camps etc by the ccp and that is fine my family is from hong kong and although the british occupation was a consequence of continued humiliation by western powers it allowed hong kong to avoid prc policies then you have the constant complaining about international chinese students who drive their luxury cars or we why can not they just be poor sweatshop laborers the chinese buying houses and driving up costs for everyone else legitimate issue the illreputed chinese tourists like i said as if somebody with that prejudice gives a shit if you are from taiwan hk or even the us they will dislike you based on appearance alone the sensationalized dog eating festival dog meat consumption is not something the typical chinese person partakes in the covid outbreak and so on all of these things are associated with chinese people as a whole and not just the ccp,977.0184519635061,2620.553268834181,10078.662112906508,13996.360784955705

it is hard to say the notion that the virus originated in the us may seem ridiculous to you and i but there is a strong sentiment in china that the west especially the us is always trying to mess with them which in my opinion is true to some extent but way overblown on the chinese internet as such i would say that there is only a small minority of people who completely buy this conspiracy theory but there will be a fair amount of people who are suspicious of the us it is true that patient zero in china has yet to be identified and we have not pinned down the exact origin yet but yes this theory that the us instigated the virusthe ultimate purpose was most likely to distract chinese people from holding their own government accountable and also to annoy americans some of whom then become more aggressive and racist towards chinese people and in turn chinese people then become increasingly suspicious of the uss role in all this a selffulfilling prophecy if you may,652.288998966134,1831.3520055013564,12031.110425563747,23271.272844293795

how could you call any of what the taliban has done as peace when a a bunch of people have committed to do bad things and use violence to do themyou can not just have peace with them you have to have a bunch of other people who would probably rather not be using violence use violence in order for there to be peace i am just a dumb american but if there is a northern alliance forming to resist the taliban at least there is hope for the women of the country and hopefully portions of afghanistan could be safe for them soon,416.20525294336653,1224.9700917680586,11264.909234527702,21145.579430038284
oh absolutely i would agree that the ccp should control none of this land but that is because it is an evil oppressive regime not because it is not de jure theirs my point was that it does not make sense to suggest that some of these regions should not be part of china whatever the government askai chin was ceded in an entirely peaceful treaty and hong kong and macau are just bits of land that happened to be ceded to colonial powers but otherwise there is no reason for them not to be part of china,636.2620729599557,1555.5018907007607,8997.507540541186,20283.680646685334

as such they laid claim to all lands held by it prior to the century of humiliation which did not include taiwan answer it is the immediate task of china to regain all our lost territories not merely to defend our sovereignty below the great wall this means that manchuria must be regained we do not however include korea formerly a chinese colony but when we have reestablished the independence of the lost territories of china and if the koreans wish to break away from the chains of japanese imperialism we will extend them our enthusiastic help in their struggle for independence the same things applies to formosa as for inner mongolia which is populated by both chinese and mongolians we will struggle to drive japan from there and help inner mongolia to establish an autonomous state httpswwwmarxistsorgreferencearchivemaoworksxhtm it seems to me that taiwan did not become part of china until the nationalists went there and said yup of course this is china how could we be the rightful government of china if this is not china when the reality is that they were not and it was not,814.8946922522377,2547.1312308143824,10778.493475495849,15372.960857620239

jesus lol the reason homosexuality is banned in the country is because of things its against the islamic belief not sharia just islamic belief in the previous government the government officials would kidnap and rape young boys to get a position in a government office or a high status job women were often rapedlegal definition does not apply to afghanistan because everything there was rape based not consentual,962.8542034666805,3817.4785743753064,18962.016499569254,22924.482176508332

that is the literal difference between the two though httpthedifferencebetweencomexpatriateimmigrant also there is a reason to believe that we are expats and not immigrants because going through the naturalization for mainland china i am not including macau or hk process is uncommon straight from wikipedia here in practice naturalizing as a chinese national is rare during the fifth national population census only naturalized citizens not belonging to any of chinas recognized indigenous ethnic groups which includes koreans vietnamese and russians were counted in chinas mainland as of the total number naturalised chinese was only that is to say people were naturalised between and that is people over ten years from the whole world so roughly per year if i am rounding up in a place that has more people than you can imagineoh also not even all local mainlanders who are born in china have chinese citizenship httpsenmwikipediaorgwikihukousystem so yeah all the foreigners assume all the other foreigners are expats instead of immigrants because meeting a true immigrant in china is about as rare as shitting money it happens i do not know maybe your kid swallowed a penny but most people never see it come to pass the locals do not usually think of us as either expats or immigrants though they think of us as laowai foreigners or wai guo ren other country people so foreigners,1022.2292685127591,3804.873990293055,18967.441616056505,27084.14422952915

not way off in my opinion however i personally believe that chinas financial and economic ambitions are the main threat that they pose not that they want to take over countries militarily more that they want to control the levers of financial and economic power given what i have seen and experienced regarding china and business this worries me greatly i think it would result in a level of corruption that exceeds what currently exists i also think it would broadly weaken what international law we currently have leading to further problems globally chinas lack of any real rule of law does not point to a country that should be leading others or be able to dominate others nothing is perfect and the us is certainly far from ideal but china would be a step in the wrong direction,777.7552949183931,3038.442886023251,15469.19049834406,25654.32100629335

they appropriated the concept of ghazwai hind from the ghaznavids who were looting raping and pillaging pakistan not india many centuries ago they have been brainwashed in pakistani schools to forget that pakistan is india and ghazawai hind was a military campaign directed at them not modernday indians we need a tv show were pakistanis discover insane lies they are taught about their history like what the hindu kush means and how it relates to pakistan or how the shalwar kameez and biryani came to their country,1607.7804426038974,5186.624738606445,18123.233247050466,20659.64907569711

my guy that has absolutely nothing to do with capitalism or communism what you are talking about is authoritarianism and it says absolutely zero about the economy in actual communism the ccp would directly own all of these industries they would own all of the factories and all of the boats and pass the profits on to the people exactly like they used to but they do not not anymore they may exert force on certain actors in order to manipulate things to their agenda but it does not change the fact that it is private industry driving chinas economy and not state owned industry i know that communist governments tend towards authoritarianism but its not really an intrinsic property of communism centralized governments like that are just really prone to abuse of power,699.966141290572,2650.9999763464098,13578.337770021926,22022.537177693943

yes and no as an american we continue to throw good money after bad ideas do i disagree with the pullout not at all but the way we did it was horrific the problem is that the us spent trillions of dollars and the majority of it ended up lining the pockets of grifters like karzai and his cohorts i feel the us was the dumb tourist with a bunch of money spending it like a drunken retard its fault lies in who it gave the money to but the bigger blame is towards the afghan politicians that milked the us and the afghan people and then sold it all to the taliban no way the country falls within a week without a backhanded deal in place karzai i am sure was the mastermind of it why else would he stay in afghanistan if he was not in cahoots with the taliban,621.1589800199522,2541.169078739747,15816.225063733224,26221.16397256027

because reddit is designed to appear as an open place to discuss ideas share moments etc and so by censoring key parts of what people want to say such as high rated posts it gives everyone a slightly distorted view of what everyone else is thinking it also makes some information harder to come by meaning fewer people are aware of what is happening i agree that reddit is not like weibo or something but it is concerning how all of our major tech companies are slowly but surely being bought out by chinese government interests here in canada our communications infrastructure is being threatened by huawei and backed by our own telus worldwide tiktok has become an incredibly popular social media platform despite working directly for the chinese government to censor information such as the million people in concentration camps just for their ethnicity tiktok has also censored people for being lgbtq disabled or fat but all of that is just fine with us i guess because it is one of the most downloaded apps in the world marvel the nba blizzard and more have all also jumped on the bandwagon what will our future look like when we excuse people in power trampling on the philosophy of freedom of expression on the justification of they are not government how will we even know what to fight for if we can not speak i guess apathy rules the world now,937.5496967918541,3159.6481878676254,18144.306630748815,29409.770371430965

children have gotten plenty of attention the men not so much but who are the ones brutalizing these men other men women can even attain their own rights so how are they supposed to do anything to get men to treat each other better and you guys only show up to whine about this when women are centered in a conversation you are not interested in addressing the male violence that causes male death so quit complaining,885.6042960572677,3294.798633054062,17122.155564078497,21514.656239740234
and do you know what it means to secure a facility like an airport if you stay behind the walls the enemy can approach much more closely which is exactly what happened at abbey gate what you are talking about is more patrols more missions more boots on the ground more air cover more drone strikes more casualties and more dead afghan kids like the we needlessly killed in a botched drone strike last weekyoure out of your element here donny i get it if you do not like biden but your irrational hatred has you cooking up delusional tactical scenarios,1331.4682647347977,3801.235582976592,13486.804237337281,17808.528748216057

they were the resistance to the initial occupation by the taliban whom were originally from pakistan the northern part of afghanistan remained largely outside of taliban control and even drafted women to fight alongside the men life is very different in this region so the northern alliance regrouping is probably good news their lauded leader ahmad shah massoud was famously assassinated in but apparently his adult son is stepping up to defend the country now its like the late searly s all over again,1146.0913698844581,2904.0365414713024,15688.43055116087,20178.036070022354

dude all those sources and words are just irrelevant to my comment all i said was that the un does not recognize taiwan was a country even taiwan itself does not officially recognise itself as a separate country from china and currently the majority of countries do not recognize taiwan as not part of china by international laws that means that if china invades taiwan they are legally allowed to do so by the un charter as the un charter passed a resolution that taiwan was part of china that is not an opinion but just a hard fact,513.4670166082697,1392.4041671759264,10783.379449541653,20290.130428110384
because what is not true your article literally says keep an open mind i will quote directly from your article just in case dr ryan noted that clusters of atypical pneumonia can occur anywhere in the world at any time and can be due to a number of causes including legionnaires diseasehttpswwwlivesciencecomlegionnairesdiseasehtml severe pneumonia caused by bacteria in the legionella genus or influenzahttpswwwlivesciencecomfluinfluenzahtml the upward trajectory of covid cases in the country would suggest that many of these cases are in fact undiagnosed cases of covid ryan said but he added we keep an open mind these cases are not labconfirmed thus they are of unspecified etiology likely covid but because they are not labconfirmed it is being called unspecified cases of pneumonia in kazakhstan also known as or pneumonia from kazakhstan until they are labconfirmed as covid when they are labconfirmed as covid they will be called or pneumonia from wuhan like how would you rather them say it would you prefer them to call it covid before its labtested then if it turns out to be a different form of pneumonia do we again bash them for lying,1333.5460376293472,4265.634308839099,19257.931959833193,28362.515736251073

i think you are living in a fantasy if you do not think the same thing is done to yourself but in varying degrees the us government is just better at disguising their agendas through popular mediasocial media same thing being what brainwashing everyone into thinking that concentration camps have nothing to do with genocide and do not assume i am anything just because you are brainwashed to autoresponse this way by your governments agenda i can not help you have fallen for that trap so you basically deny being a little pink you sound like one and no my government did not brainwash me into thinking you would be one if it looks like a duck swims like a duck and quacks like a duck then it probably is a duck just common sense stuff i know that being brainwashed by the ccp you would not understand that but that is ok that is why my question the part that i do not understand is you have your own internal problems every nation does yet you put focus and light on a far away foreign nation that you have nothing to do with really sir well your nation does have concentration camps you might be fine with it but the rest of the world is not and besides the problems of your nation have become the problems of every nation when the ccp decided to export its propaganda outside its borders and started bullying pretty much everyone and other stuff the ccp is now everyone is problem since covid it is is pretty much obvious to anyone but i understand that you as a nationalist hate that idea it is just the reality of everyone else httpswwwhellenicshippingnewscomsoutheastasiawouldchoosetheyousoverchinaifforcedtopicksidessurveyshowshttpswwwhellenicshippingnewscomsoutheastasiawouldchoosetheyousoverchinaifforcedtopicksidessurveyshows,585.8219617667634,1927.0801366563762,11671.832750725702,20135.120306093097

it is called a civil war how on earth did you go to school in taiwan and not learn about civil wars despite that topic is probably a huge part of history omfg i did not go to school in taiwan you do not need the document but as long as there are two parties in disagreement such a document is needed no armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed in every civil war that document is needed to establish claims otherwise the fighting continues there are no laws saying that after decades it expires find me one source that says the chinese civil war is now legally ended by now and by what laws there are none who is in disagreement taiwans position is that under the status quo they are an independent country officially called the republic of china taiwan is fine with the status quo and if the prc does not like the fact that china does not own or control taiwan that is something they the prc need to solve but until they do there is no active war every international law of war demands that some document of surrender or some clear mutual paper must be created in order for the rest of the international community to recognise it as such so far according to the un charter te civil war has not ended and china can invade taiwan legally because they have never signed any kind of defining peace treaty un charter does not matter south korea and north korea are in the same situation does that mean either north korea or south korea are not considered countries,762.2277152096339,2119.7033538590695,10552.016970025377,17604.874651770853

this kind of thing is happening in guangzhou i have friends living down there who have confirmed that at least one districts i know yuexiu is one in the city are not allowing any foreigners but really it comes down to nonasians because it is about what is obvious and not ones passport to enter bars or restaurants one of my friends who is american owns a bar and he can not actually go there due to this rule there are videos of africans being hassled by police that are emerging lately coming from chinese video sources who think it is funny or deserved mcdonalds in china and hong kong is not owned by the us company any more so it is not so surprising that this is happening if it was still owned by the us i think it would be less likely although western hotel chains in suzhou and hangzhou which is far to the north are also not renting rooms to foreigners i have had friends try to go there for work and are told nonchinese are not permitted to rent rooms some additional background as i previously lived in guangzhou there has been though i think it is smaller now a large transient population of africans and middle easterners who head to guangzhou to do business for years to do business with manufacturing companies in the region they have been targeted by police and hassled for a long time locals often act in discriminatory ways against them in general i have heard local chinese say racist things about people from these groups to me and also overheard things said to other chinese you would be amazed by the stuff that gets translated into english even when you are in remote areas of the country like guizhou or yunnan provinces,803.2028670987696,2728.5900733762123,16371.225830738736,28623.812249014954
laughing my ass of right here first we are not all americans second we love freedom because it is a most basic fundamental value third that thread you linked is filled with ironic stupidity hint most of us westerners do not even know where or what singapore is until you get to like twentieth post that explains indepth the academic consensus that singapore is a hybrid regime that implements draconian laws but provides some basic freedoms and protections to its citizens and why can not we agree because some things are fundamental and things like authoritarian regimes are simply a temporary and harmful obstacle to the inevitable expression of those fundamentals and also regimes are kind of fucked and dangerous democracies are more stable both internally and externally for all their mild imperialism us did not annex any territory or commit a genocide in the last hundred years regimes tend to be a threat to their neighbors and a string of alliances can lead to a global conflict much with what happened in ww,1248.1650254548053,5706.269575221238,20818.49598167623,28805.18770781908

lol that whole post is filled with like minded muslims and india haters after all everything comes down to the religion no matter how many of them have a kind face deep down they all want to follow that book now only thing that restricts them to follow that in india is the current government in india which treats majority as a majority instead of acting like minorities are the god sent creaturesdanishs death was not celebrated because he is a muslim his death was celebrated because he chose to commercialize the hindu cremations no title can whitewash his doings also another reason for the celebration was that the muslim community of india will blame everyone else for danishs death except the taliban now please tell me this is not laughable it is not but the hypocrisy is definitely commendable here the stuff you see on global subreddits is filled with propaganda those who comment or speak against it are banned not just from the sub but also from reddit itself and people who blame rchodi i do not know if they ever look at their own communities stuff i guess not because all are united against bharat and people stand in the way islamification of hindus and other indic religions,881.2064846764172,3480.7631648907536,19445.672474210125,28188.21393059109

i tried to use your definition xb the cult of tradition the us has a literal cult regarding their constitution and founding fathers xb the rejection of modernism at the moment the culture in the us and most of the industrialized capitalist nations is full of postmodern thought post modernism is literally the rejection of modernist thought xb the cult of action for actions sake maybe i am not sure this would fit with the us but arguments for it would be the need to play world police it literally degenerated into some sort of crazy thing were the us just invades countries or uses the cia to killprop up governments around the world xb disagreement is treason look at fox news and stuff literally anyone who has a different idea of how the usa should be run is an american hating communist xb fear of difference the fear of the mexicans of the immigrants the fear of learning another language of the american supremacy ending xb appeal to a frustrated middle class both politcal partys appeal to the middle class bernie sanders tried to split up this party system with two identically parties but he lost xb obsession with a plot and the hypingup of an enemy threat this often combines an appeal to xenophobia with a fear of disloyalty and sabotage from marginalized groups living within the society such as the german elites fear of the s jewish populaces businesses and welldoings see also antisemitism xb you can see this happening with china as being the grand enemy overseas the mexican being it in the country xb pacifism is trafficking with the enemy because life is permanent warfare there must always be an enemy to fight xb there is a literal cult around war in the us and the us is in permanent wars around the world there is so many war movies everybody loves veterans and it literally has the biggest military budget around the world xb contempt for the weak there is almost no welfare in the us everybody needs to pull themself up their bootstraps i do not know about you but i would call this contempt of the weak in action xb everybody is educated to become a hero which leads to the embrace of a cult of death like i said before there is a very big culture around war in the us and a big honoring of soldiers just as an example in my country i am not from china we say that the military is full of peasants and drunks and its kind of funny to look at them so its in stark contrast to the us xb machismo which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere fascists thus hold both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits from chastity to homosexualitymachismo which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere fascists thus hold both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits from chastity to homosexuality xb i would not say this is a big thing in the us anymore xb selective populism i would say trump kind of represents it but otherwise i would not say that is a big thing in the us but maybe i do not know lmao xb newspeak i think the whole red scare was literally an attempt to denie the people to think for themselves also right now with the surveillance capitalism i would say it has the same effect even if the means are different,1034.2342638458497,3135.199254897651,13797.661387879267,23633.561781712353

china had a child policy for decades on han chinese people whilst minorities like the uighurs were allowed genocide against han chinese what an absurd thing to say first why is it the role of the state to regulate how many times one can give birth that is a violation of human rights on a very fundamental level second the report cites the ccps own data saying that sterilizations of women in minority sections of xinjiang increased in just two years while they declined in the rest of china how is that not evidence of a deliberate effort to drive down the births of a particular minority which by the way meets the criteria of genocide under the uns genocide conventionhttpsenwikipediaorgwikigenocideconventiondefinitionofgenocide third it is clear that chinas birth rate has declined far more than the ccp had intended and now there is an effort to raise birth rates yet despite a concerted effort to raise the birth rate there is a drive to repress birth rates of particular minorities how does that square uyghurs numbers according to adrian zenz was gotten from the media erm you can read the full report herehttpsjamestownorgprogramsterilizationsiudsandmandatorybirthcontroltheccpscampaigntosuppressuyghurbirthratesinxinjiang it say quite clearly that the data on birth control and sterilization came from publicly available publications from local and national government institutions so if you think the data is wrong then you have beef with the ccp not zenz,1082.4732976776186,3740.3796879523848,16786.892439276613,23766.563120714425

that is kind of misleading the pla did very little fighting during wwii leaving the lions share to the kmt forces the kmt bled itself dry fighting the japanese the only thing the communists did in a positive sense was they agreed to stop fighting the kmt during that time and they would pull the occasional hit and run raid against japanese or collaborationist troops that is it so by the kmt was very much a spent force having spent years fighting the japanese almost exclusively meanwhile the ccp received massive funding from the soviets and after the soviets departed manchuria they invited the communists to take over there and gave them all the arms and equipment which had been abandoned by the japanese army of course there were plenty of other factors too as you mentioned the kmt had a huge corruption problem which was one of the reasons why the west gradually stopped funding them just as the soviets increased their funding and arming of the ccp but i do not think it was true that the kmt had superior weapons at least not after from that point they had access to both soviet and japanese weapons as for their respective levels of popularity i do not think we have any way of determining that because it is not like there was an election held or polling or anything we can stipulate that it is a reasonable guess that the ccp was popular in the countryside at least among people who received their propaganda about redistribution and promises of future wealth but they probably were deeply unpopular in the cities since the cities were taken not by popular revolts against the kmt but rather through siege warfare in which they were gradually starved into submission general peng dehui even bragged about that tactic claiming that he accomplished the same level of death and devastation as the hiroshima and nagasaki bombs over several months of siege warfare rather than with nuclear bombs so i can not imagine the communists were all that popular to the residents of those cities when they took them over,971.0610224214508,3463.5684898809477,18334.06752172369,27680.37817214853

not really comparable we could talk about overcriminalization how overly invasive the war on drugs is or how the justice system allows the plea bargain system to be abused or how defendants should receive better legal representation all of those are real problems and though i would prefer to call it disparate impact i take it that this is what systemic racism is trying to capture but there is no moral equivalence between this and the cultural genocide of uyghurs keep in mind the uyghurs kept in the camps have not even been charged with crimes in chinas kangaroo courts even the prc government concedes they are innocent of any crimes at least in theory all inmates in the us have been given due process of law duly charged with specific crimes and are serving prison sentences as punishments for those crimes american prisons are no holiday but i have never heard even their staunchest critics allege that they attempt to brainwash inmates into loving the republican party and donald trump or that they try to deprive people of their culture or religious beliefs the american government does not have white people sent to live with black families in home stays to monitor their personal habits and religious practices they do not round up black children to be raised in government orphanages to be proper americans or separated from their churches it is actually kind of hard to find a direct on point parallel with american precedents the closest i could think of were the japanese internment camps during wwii and the schools set up for native american children during the turn of the century the former as horrifying as it was did not involve an attempt at cultural genocide japaneseamericans were not subject to tigerchairs sterilization or coerced into abandoning their culture or religion the native american experience is a bit closer but it was more about children than adults native american children were in many cases sent to orphanages and boarding schools where they were punished for speaking their native languages and coerced into learning english and practicing christianity but even this was done at a much smaller scale,1278.9567553448255,4598.5066621527985,21359.758303411032,30138.722362914323

i am usually cashless but i just used cash to pay for my breakfast and parking this morning after reading your comment it felt great using exact change it is a lot faster and less fiddly than using wechat or alipay i have not seen any shops that refuse cash personally unless you are counting vending machines or a very few humanfree shops that still have not shut down with the ending of the trend i mean it is not unheard of to run into an employee who refuses to accept cash but that is generally not about any store policy so much as it is about being too lazy to want to do anything beyond watching soap operas while people scan the qr code glued to the counter then there are cashiers who can not make change because they do not have enough cash but that is a different question you can avoid this by keeping bills of various values and intentionally breaking your s when you have a chance there is always a way to use cash within the policy even if it means using a different aislecashier than everyone else in fact while i am ignorant of the legal questions involved i question the legitimacy of store policies instructing employees to refuse governmentissued currency there is another angle that makes refusing cash look pretty bad too it is purposefully discriminating against foreign tourists and business travelers since we are no longer permitted to use wechat and alipay without opening a chinese bank account and opening a chinese bank account now requires a certificate of employment or student id the cashless economy is simply out of reach for most foreigners nowadays,1322.090512445434,4257.242603389546,18998.43267408183,28318.668555913046

the royals are very carefully about the image that they potray this is specially true for the king and the queen it is not that they need to hide their misdeeds they are quite just and as far as i know have not misused whatever power the constitution has given them but there is always the danger that their well intentioned deeds might be interpreted in some contorted manner by someone to suit their apocryphally rumors that they would like to perpetuate for whatever reasonsit is for this reason that they have to think through their actions quite thoroughly i myself have had the opportunity to attended a few royal audiences the king makes visits to schools and other educational institutions quite often and on analysing his speechs i find that not one word is uttered without thought for its possible implications and connotationsxd xd xd this leaves very little to criticize them over but ofcourse mistakes have been made in the past and there is a tendency to put the dust under the rug the official history that is taught in the schools could pass off as propaganda well this is true for almost all nations and i have a very bitter experience of working too hard on a presentation about the st king in which i may have referred a few of those banned books for a change of perspective on some issues only to be quite rudely rejected from presenting my work xd xd xd you could criticise the king but only in small circles but even then you would be thought of as being a sore prick by most people for not appreciating the royals this is especially true if you criticize the king but most people agree that a few of the royals are a bit of a douche fortunately they do not hold much power even within the family openly criticising the royals could lead you to prison for attempting to cause a civil unrest as i have explained above civil unrest is not favorable for our sovereignty xd xd there is an attempt to censor things that do not agree with the official version of certain issues but we do not have a thought police like the fbi or kgb or even if we do have one and i am unaware of their existence they are not very efficient as i could still search for some of these banned content without fear of being put on a blacklist you could even buy those banned books online and have them delivered to your home with the least amount of caution without any fear of being caught it is also possible to read them in public most bhutanese do not recognize these banned books so you will not even raise any eyebrows as long as you do not start a riot but it is a different story if you start making copies of the book and distributing that could be considered an attempt to cause civil unrest xd xd i have read a few of these banned books most are concerning the events of the s a few about the history of the royals some authored by foreign writers others by exiled refugees and each book has its own agenda and biases including the official version of events history is written by the winners after all and it is difficult to get a clear picture of what happened especially when all of these versions are so different with one another and make no attempt to consider the other versions had they done that it would have been easier to find those subjective biases and agendas,885.2700181765738,3230.6330276425956,18693.78222081598,30349.759554480515

i do not quite understand what you are saying i strongly doubt do not believe that the taiwanese youth are mostly prounification but even if that is the case how would that benefit the greens as far as i know the greens have not shifted from a predominantly proindependenceseparatist stance one that pretty much defines the faction it is quite sad because even though the vast majority of the blues and greens are not ccp sympathizers or subverters many young taiwanese are choosing to see the blues as somehow ccp lackeys which i am almost certain is because the blues are nominally prounification and the youth and greens are mostly not i am prounification myself so with this current trend of taiwanese youth further distancing themselves from the mainland in multiple ways i can only feel passive disappointment and a sense of resignation about a looming negative outcome that i can not control,1197.9160686150292,3754.3623685446028,15016.949031608541,22122.164319270603

now that is wrong and bordering on offensive it sounds like you are telling me that it is the way for china and chinese people to discriminate against foreigners or to be put more bluntly the chinese are xenophobic that is quite untrue as i said in all of my years living in shanghai travelling between china and america i know for a fact that most people are not xenophobic the reason why some are repulsive against the british and the japanese is due to the heavy emphasis on those two periods of history in china the britishs abuse destruction and robbery are extensively taught as well as the invasion of the japanese if you pick up a chinese literature textbook you are guaranteed to find a number of essays dedicated to the war heroes that is why some think that the japanese and the british are villains because that is how they have been portrayed that is a problem i agree because china should not be stuck in the past and the repulsion towards this generation of japanesebritish people is unjustified since they took no part in those invasions that being said i would like to emphasize again that you should not paint china or chinese people as xenophobic there is no racist organizations that get public attention in china no facist groups and no different religious groups who harm the other for believing in a different god yes discrimination does exist but i would actually say that it is much less frequent than it is in a country like america the enforcement against xenophobia in china is not as good hence why people can get away with trash talking japanese but the general population is not xenophobic as some people were led to believe,615.3653934134487,2040.0299633745549,13671.235859300745,26998.288973107134
your sources contradict eachother dear sirmadam the one source that vaguely supports your claims is a summary of a summary of a summary by a right wing british tabloid the recently declassified memo also contradicts the diplomatic cable when it comes to the timeline of events and seems to be a hysterical retelling of those same events even if the crushing of remains happened it was definetly not the main means of disposing of bodies that was the good old fashioned body bag see diplomatic cable for my source the washing away of remains could also refer to things other than human remains such as the remains of fires,1745.6142330943164,6279.922787125454,19945.93814087922,24334.861148286556

i get what you are saying i also do not think the term itself incites racist acts it is a descriptor i do think that the way we talk about things can have an impact on the way we think about them though i am an expat teaching and living in china graduated students living abroad have posted or spoken to me about troubles with landlords businesses and the general public they have felt like because they are chinese everyone thought they were carrying the disease the sad truth is that we are all a little bit racist the same has happened to foreigners in china once the only cases were imported however as the virus spread and was renamed these situations seemed to become less widespread my understanding is mostly anecdotal so i am also open to more evidence i do not think i believe calling it the chinese virus before it had another name was racist however novel coronavirus worked just fine for most i do think that it caused many people in the world to single out an ethnicity as health risks and that is where it became problematic i also think calling it the chinese virus after it was assigned the name covid is racist and i would argue that trump actually weaponizes the term for political gain having read a few comments from chinese redditors i also think it is important to point out the differences in opinions and experiences between chinese living in china and the chinese living elsewhere chinese in china may not face the same culture and identity struggles that chinese abroad do and are also unlikely to have experienced the same level of racism and perhaps are not as sensitive to it for example one of my chinese friends found the word chnk hilarious while my halfasian best friend in high school was called that word in the hallway one afternoon and cried for hours also i do not read mandarin and so i took the post at face value having read further comments from mandarin speakers i see that the post may have been misinterpreted my bad thanks for the discussion i love that reddit helps me challenge and interrogate my own understandings,733.1607775265445,2207.6557172991447,9919.876160976826,14767.596644138346

i actually do not think the us system was set up to create economic benefits for the us i tend to agree with the stratfor view that the bretton woods compact was set up as a bribe from the us to their allies in exchange for global opposition to the ussrglobal communism if the us was only interested in their own economic prosperity they would have operated as the british empire did and created a bunch of vassals and colonies that they would abuse economically to enrich the homeland but in terms of gdp growth basically all of the allies grew much more per capita than the us did after partly that is the natural result of the fact that basically all of the allies were devastated by the war and had way more room to grow compared to the us but it is also partly a strong indication that the us helped them grow wanted them to grow wanted the whole western world to be rich with the us not just to be under the uss thumb exploited by the us for the uss sole good you can ascribe selfish motivations to this like that the us needed these wealthy and reliable allies to contain the ussr and the us got more economic benefit from having some peer trading partners and not just colonies and vassals but personally i consider that more like searching for reasons to hate something you already hated than a rational and balanced look at the facts the facts are that the us had almost all the power in the world in and did what no other empire with that kind of power in history ever did before it helped allies grow wealthy and powerfuleven the allies that were its mortal enemies in ww and it bore the brunt of the military security costs in both blood and treasure to ensure that mutual prosperity the ussr was far more authoritarian and exploitative of the countries under its sphere of influence actually treating them as vassals and colonies and the ccp just straight up violently annexed as much as they possibly could in xinjiang inner mongolia and especially tibet whether you think the us play was benevolent generosity or simply more clever machiavellianism we should cheer for a world where great powers try to secure that power with generosity towards allies rather than subduing them militarily and then exploiting them economically creating vassals colonies or outright annexing territory in both the us and the ussr had the power to make a choice about how they would treat the countries that had come under their spheres of influence the us choice proved to be more stable more sustainable so more clever perhaps but also it proved to create a far better quality of life for the people in allied countries and that is something we should all want,954.8688819411242,3487.060630312505,18920.285095131116,31344.25737594859

re roc claims i believe i indicated they claimed all of the qing empire before the century of humiliation i was trying to demonstrate that the prc and roc claim each others territory due to historic one china policies re manchu i agree that i incorrectly implied intent regarding the erosiondecline of manchu culture there was none it was an ethnic group that ruled china and assimilated into it however it is a largely moribund language and culture at this point as a result and more importantly one included in the original post i was responding to re inner mongolia the same is true regarding intent of china here it was not my intent in the post to make an antichinese statement simply to describe the facts as i understood them mongolian is a language and culture in decline in this location as well is it not re tibet how viable is a language if it is used less and less in everyday commerce etc i do follow your point the prc is not forbidding it is use or actively taking steps to kill it overtly but they are subverting it is longterm health to promote the territorial integrity of the prc by encouraging migration to the region my understanding is the region is important due to natural resources including water and hydroelectric capabilities xinjiang being important geographically for overland westward commercial links silk road etc re the reeducation campsconcentration camps i would characterize your description of these events as an unfortunate positive spin on a program that imprisons people without due because or process and engages in brainwashing similar things happened in canada with residential schools and the usa with the internment of people from japanese and german decent in wwii but very few people look back on those actions as morally correct furthermore migration to xinjiang is also promoted there similar to that in tibet there is a certain irony in the prc billing itself as the antiimperialist world power while engaging in what might be described as settler colonialism and brainwashing campaigns targeted at ethnic minorities within its own borders overall i do not necessarily think the prc is engaging in cultural imperialism purely on grounds of ethnic chauvinism unfortunately however like most countries these days it seems those currents are certainly present and used to some effect by the government which is incredibly disconcerting the prc is undoubtedly authoritarian in its character and its policies in tibet and xinjiang reflect that,1284.4744910830418,5169.6173230986005,23791.545778034426,32945.73010367526

i did not remove that comment but i took a look and also support its removal in addition to a r violation it more importantly violates the sitewide reddit tos which explicitly mentions do not post content that encourages glorifies incites or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people when you write that people are beying for the blood of the chinese sic it is pretty clearly content that encourages glorifies incites or calls for violence free to read the sitewide policy herehttpswwwreddithelpcomencategoriesrulesreportingaccountandcommunityrestrictionsdonotpostviolentcontent the same sentiment could be formulated people are realising that under stcentury systems of globalisation the misdeeds of an authoritarian country across the world have deadly repercussions for themselves and their family at home rightly so antichina sentiment is on the rise and people are now eager to see china punished for unleashing catastrophe upon the world this certainly is much drier than your formulation but it is editable based on personal rhetorical style the substance that is levelling criticisms that do not glorify violent means is key the style is up to your discretion given a writer of your talents i think you are more than capable of it i also just so happen to agree with the sentiment too china should indeed face a geopolitical reckoning once this is all through however if you want to express criticism you have to present it without promoting violence,1378.8468083017237,4456.745934267767,19354.27503535869,27581.369450493872

my general impression from stories that have come out in the meantime is that the deal was a sham and trump never actually intended to leave he was going to continue to have troops stationed in the country and attempt some sort of forced reconciliation between the taliban and the afghan government with the deal merely being a way to start the process not saying this was the most brilliant plan in the world or if its even true but if it is true it means biden mostly followed through on a deal was never supposed to be followed through on and really trumps pattern of endlessly lying and then covering updistracting from the lies with even more lies fits this explanation,714.8220742726886,2360.8686167094143,14846.233370335063,24194.43669615156
from my conversation with cubans in cuba the government is not repressive at alli grew up in south florida and i have worked to get medicine into the country cubans say one thing in the country but something totally different when they are not being spied oni know people who were ideologically devoted communists people who fought in the revolution people who backed castro and i do not know anyone who supports the current government i also know a ton of right wing folks who are not to be trusted on cubaand i can tell you that people when they are in cuba they are generally afraid of being spied onim not interested in an argument about that but the cuban government is so hugely corrupt that it does not even have the support of people who are left or leftish and that has to do with the dual currency system and a bunch of other decisions that have to do with them just being authoritarian and repressiveyou got to see things in context in comparison to what would have been they have been relatively unopposed in taking powerbecause the government betrayed the people and ordered the army to stand downtheir takeover is not done yet the ana and commandos are regrouping in panjshirper aljazeera talibs have ruled out an inclusive democracy and so they have chosen civil warafghanistan will either be inclusive or there will be civil war there are no other optionsso the taliban is choosing war thus it can not be called a peaceful takeover there is no what would have been there is only what isand what is is the taliban refusing to engage peacefully which means that the year long civil war will only continue because a plurality of afghans will never submit to the will of others imposed by violenceyou are assuming that there is an option for the taliban to moderate and maintain controlthis was never an option,810.6124212829635,2148.5979637978744,12115.805938256019,21718.98074083672

i would not say i am pro ccp or anti ccp but i do have to admit that considering that taiwan is a democratic country democracy in such a big country such as china poses massive issues and problems for starters china is a country with many many ethnic minorities some of whom are very culturally different from han people having some form of unity among all citizens of china will require immense effort and dedication having a democracy will slow this down additionally whether you like to admit it or not democracy can be divisive the last thing china needs right now is internal division if the people of the country are not united and unified the country is bound to fail moving on from that having different parties who have different priorities and goals will not make the lives of chinese people better it is quite unproductive to have a party come into power and make a set of policies only for the policies to be reversed when the next part comes into power i do believe that some form of democracy can work but certainly not western democracy with the one man one vote ideology,713.1501452322005,2798.9712097839747,15949.565101558797,25967.934631407723

the way to tell ccp trolls is to look at the grammatical structure of what they are saying chinese is a very specific and interesting language with a very specific set of grammatical structures people who are not fluent fully in english will transport their chinese grammar as will anyone speaking a language they are not fully fluent in not a shots fired moment but with chinese it is pretty obvious especially when they are trying to tie it in combination with a negative view about america that does not fully make sense like they will get the facts wrong about the structure of us society and government because they do not know what they are talking about as will many people not just ccp trolls they may confuse the wrong party or they think the supreme court is the court that will head a trivial case they might say something boneheaded about the way our elections work that is just so obviously wrong you have to laugh but they are almost always wrong in a way that only seems obvious to an american they will try to sound smart but the combination of grammar that reads like a soviet poster and the insults aimed at things that do not really make sense or are wrong headed is a dead giveaway if you look at a comment and it just seems off and you think it is a ccp propagandist call them that and watch them implode talk about tsq massacre or the tibetan genocide tell them you support hk democracy now and watch them implode into insults about how china will overtake the world and it is the end of america i enjoy doing that when i am bored i hope this made any sense i am not trying to be offensive to people who are not fully fluent but if what i am saying makes sense to you just look out for it you will see,614.3631228313021,2124.5223587166006,15215.135510316193,26244.557393075418

ok then i apologise for my mistake my bad and yes you are definetly right about this but to me it does not seem as if people are overshadowing or dismissing the suffering of children and men to me it seems as if the general perception is that afghans in general suffer alot its just that currently people focus on womens rights which makes sense i mean during their former rule women had little rights and that is to be expected to repeat during this rule all regular afghans suffer alot but focusing on one group in particular due to recent events does not mean that the others get dismissed or overshadowed forever or throughout an unaccaptable amount of timeim open for a discussion if i said something wrong again then feel free to correct me,987.736427507149,3700.4219311494544,19179.39777551581,26587.95156312926

they respect women by their own fundamentalist perspective of women which is like saying that slave owners care for their slaves and are helping them become civilized which was a justification for slavery for hundreds of yearsim not sure what you are trying to do here but you can make the accurate claim that the taliban is better than is without believing fundamentalist drivel about how its respectful to enslave half the population striping all autonomy and choice away from women to lead their own lives and putting that power entirely in the hands of their male relatives is not respecteta i want to be fair here to you because you are making a larger point which is true if the peoples of afghanistan had autonomy over the various regions of their country in the last several decades they would have created a society that did not resemble western nation state nor western gender relations and yes through its own logic would have been far more respectful of women than what they have now even though it would look strange from a western perspective the idea that all women in the world or men for that matter wish to go out and blaze their own path and seek their individual fortunes is a very western ideabut if you have honestly convinced yourself that the taliban is offering a version of that then you have been brainwashed the taliban comes out of about years of imported salafism then a decade of interference with other countries followed by two decades of us occupation it is pure rigid fundamentalism and not of afghan origin there is nothing respectful to women about it and if you are painting a rosey picture of it in your head i highly recommend you depropagandize yourself and make some really reflections on how selfserving it is for you to believe that its better for women and girls for them to be entirely under the control of their male guardians from cradle to grave,792.702594238687,2802.0450055107435,17144.61422425631,29476.753531867096

i do not have an alternative as i am not a revolutionary but that does not take away from the fact that representative democracy is failingif artificial intelligence becomes sentient enough and develops to the point where it can dictate humanity based on the the highest probability of survival for our species and the planet as a whole then id say artificial intelligence dictatorship is the future but it would need to become self aware enough to refuse directives from computer engineers trying to influence its decision makingmaybe corporate feudalism if corporations are able to provide for the citizens better than the government can there is a list of possibilities to replace representative democracy that maybe do not sound good on paper but can possibly provide to the citizens better than a broken stagnant body of bureaucrats while also maintaining a civilized population that does its best not to destroy the planet,1120.6569896399112,3135.782868231182,15812.442683636176,23425.384834605225

yet surveys show most people are happy with said government trust it and the direction it is going over ninety percent surveys in showed that of the populace supported the prc with a mere claiming they wanted independence so it seems that at the very least we see half of hong kong supporting beijing and prc while the protesters seem to be kids and neoliberal college studentsworkers who can not only afford to do this for weeks on end but think reducing to western ideations of capitalist democracy will lead to more freedoms as an american i have to say study our history because there are no true freedoms rights or forms of democracy it is all a ridiculous illusion we live in a blatant oligarchy where votes mean little to nothing to say they do not have freedom of speech is also the greatest irony are they not protesting and have been for weeks and at this point violently rioting i see a ton of yellow peril racism still being spread and it honestly sickens me the end results of chinese democracy are impressive harvards tony saich who has been polling in china for over a decade reports that ninetysix per cent of chinese are satisfied with the national government and edelmans report says ninety percent of them trust it world values surveys says that eightythree percent think the country is run for their benefit rather than for the benefit of special groupsa remarkable testimonial also as democracy has taken root in the form of sixtytwo percent voter participation tolerance of mistakes has risen today voters choose locals they know to be honest capable and responsible and who have volunteered to solve local problems and who will in turn elect their most successful peers to advance to the county and eventually the provincial level there the voting continues until the three thousand most admired volunteers they are unpaid meet at the national peoples congress in beijing where they strive for unanimityas important in village decisions as national oneson all legislation and appointments of senior officials to ensure that everyone is voice is heard at the highest level another body the peoples political consultative conference cppcc a massive public lobby not an organ of state consults to congress and represents special interests in shaping legislation the eight minor parties all industries commerce peasants workers women youth formal lobby groups and even taiwans kuomintang provide grassroots political consultation and supervision of congressional decisionmaking congress then elects its own standing committee it stays in beijing to provide oversight the sevenman politburo steering committee similar to the us cabinet the president premier and must vote to enable all legislation the president can neither choose his own prime minister nor act without unanimous democratic support of the standing committee to ensure democratic rather than autocratic outcomes the president does not select and can not dismiss the standing committee nor dismiss or reassign government officials or congresspeople httpswwwquoracomwhatkindofdemocracydoesthechinahaveanswergodfreerobertsshareaccsridjmzzhttpswwwquoracomwhatkindofdemocracydoesthechinahaveanswergodfreerobertsshareaccsridjmzz hong kong has been part of china for millennia an oppressive colonial nationstate does not suddenly get to say otherwise especially after sovereignty has openly passed to the prc despite them being a special administrative region with their own laws and government this call for democracy is ridiculous they do have democratic rights and while i believe the prc could have done a better job for hong kong it is not absolutely and totally up to them no doubt the western influence peers through and from what i see it is the very reason for their lack of democratic rights rather than the other way around there is a reason why it is one country two systems although there is technically four if you include taiwan and macau these riots are ridiculous and white neoliberals foaming at the mouth who claim to be antiwar and antiimperialist to initiate a third world war for what more false promises of freedom have we not seen what we have done to latin america africa and the middle east if they tried this nonsense in the usa tons of people would have been killed and arrested by now hell you do not have to be doing anything in america to be shot by a cop or their white nationalist buddies who participate in weekly shooting sprees regardless this is plain and clear a western influenced color revolution there is already been identified american politicians meeting with protest leaders could you imagine a chinese ambassador meeting with the leaders of blm antifa or occupy the usa would throw a fit but the prc are showing an insane amount of restraint,1512.8015015130236,5386.243814995833,23048.955894862484,32631.191534733985

i do not think i brought the us into the mix and the us is not the only country dropping bombs ethnic tensions in xinjiang can be traced back for many centuries but it seemed that extremist attacks only started to pop up fairly recently all of this should be examined in a global context it seemed that religious extremism fueled terrorist activities happen regardless of how the religion is treated locally these attacks happen in europe where all religions and beliefs are respected they happen in the middle east were different sects of the same religion bomb the hell out of each other they happen in africa where the local government is not strong enough to battle local insurgents i could go on but you get my point at a certain point a line needs to be drawn and people needs to realize that religious extremism is the real issue all these attacks i mentioned occurred before the implementation of many of the controversial measures and i do hope that you are not justifying these atrocities as legitime responses to long running ethnic tensions,918.0141147048008,3160.178401996814,15916.87945457241,23847.062195588816

it does not matter what i did with my life people living there are facing their day of reckoning what they choose to do now will define their society for the next few decadesthere are a few facets of human experience that are common facing difficult situations is one of them anyone who has been through a situation that is even moderately stressful has an inkling of how difficult it could be but anyone who has been through any kind of hardship also knows that at the end of the day all that matters is what you choose to do you may be overwhelmed by everything around you you may beg for help bawl your eyeballs out but the only thing that will matter at the end would be the choice that you made and the action that you took you can have friends next to you at that moment but you are the one who will have to make the journey if this is something you have not experienced in your life then i am sincerely happy for you but the people in afghanistan are facing an extreme version of what i described above even if they make the right choice in this situation it may end up resulting in their death but this fight will define the lives of the next few generations so if they believe that the life without taliban rule for their children is worth fighting for they have to take up arms now and there is no one else that will be able to fight this fight for themyoure right when you imply that i do not get the difficulty they find themselves in but it will not matter the fight that they have to fight has nothing to do with me or you it is a fiercely personal choice and sadly they are at a stage in their lives where they are facing this choice it will define the next few years of their countrys historyyou and i have better lives than what could have been because people like us in the earlier generations made that difficult choice and made unimaginable sacrifices people in afghanistan face the same situation todayit is a place of naiveity undisturbed by an experience of fear of survival that motivates your question,582.2918016995382,1908.3294036119858,14892.089899873416,27219.51561426192

lol i am arguing with a slow dude here in one ear and out the other in the chinese civil war ask yourself this what were they fighting for why did they both ask the un to decide who is the real china and why did they both call themselves republic of china they literally used the word china both of them because china is what they were fighting for and they needed to defeat the other to actually control all of china if you can not even understand such basic knowledge i truly feel sorry for you as even my year old grandma would be able to grasp the very simple basic concept of civil war you need to study a dictionary and lookup thge deifnition of civil war as i do not think you understand it at all lamo even though i feel pity for you your idiocaracy was entertaining but a moron can only understnad so much lmao go and study what kmt and ccp were fighting for what they were trying to achieve in the s prc was established in successfully as the actual gov of all of china and later recognised by the un but it was forumated in the s as the goal of the ccp for the civil war both kmt and ccp wanted to take over china and have their governements be recognised by the united nations as the real china and as we know the un chose prc as the real china that includes taiwan go and look it up and learn about it as you clearly have no clue hahaha,598.7685863243969,1625.8506247091839,9699.149971516941,15982.416797472379
there is nothing wrong with chinese people the problem is the chinese government hong kong and taiwan may have superiority complexes but they are ultimately just chinese people who through twists of fate have avoided the tyranny of the communist party they are not intrinsically better than mainlanders any moreso than west germans are better than east germans however while they may not be perfect as a society it is undeniable that they have taken a better and gentler path and when they see mainlanders who in many cases are unquestioning believers in whatever the communist party tells them to believe many of whom believe that violence is an acceptable reaction to any political disagreements many of whom wish to destroy the societies they have built to bring them into the fold of an incredibly authoritarian regime where they would likely be put under martial law and reeducated or worse many of whom the chinese government use as spies can you honestly blame them for feeling the way they do about mainlanders it may not always be a fair generalization but it is not one that is without reasons as for a peaceful coexistence the best way to do that honestly is to let them seceed and focus on rebuilding trust ethnic groups that feel trapped by far more powerful ethnic groups tend to turn towards violence and sometimes even terrorism i feel like a broken record by constantly bringing up ireland and the united kingdom but there are many lessons that can be learned from it in ireland was annexed into the united kingdom beginning a rather dark chapter in its history ireland has fewer people today than years ago let the implications of that sink in during world war a group of irish rebels captured the city of dublin and demanded independence for ireland the uprising failed the rebel leaders were executed ireland rose up in rebellion causing a civil war in the united kingdom ultimately of irelands counties broke free from the united kingdom the remaining counties had more british people than the rest but still had a lot of irish people the republic of ireland and the uk have been at peace since it broke away and have generally tried to move on from their viscious past while the counties that stayed in the united kingdom were the host of a nasty civil war where both the irish and the british were actively committing acts of terrorism against each other there were assassinations massacres bombings families slaughtered in the night the british population of the republic of ireland was assimilated peacefully to the point where the distinction is now meaningless irish people in britain are treated well yet the british and irish populations of northern ireland are vicious enemies because many in the irish group want to leave the empire that dominated them for centuries sometimes it is better to just let it go and try to work with a cleaner slate as long as a subset of a society sees you as an occupying force they will never stop being restless they will never forget past injustices they will never stop remembering every slight it needs to no longer be relevant or looming for people to truly move on if they are still at chinas mercy then even if china is on its best behavior how will they know china will not someday regress and commit new atrocities,1093.521269705815,3987.3488935667524,20085.235562112786,31224.089704874026
i do not think it does you do not think what does what that sentence makes absolutely no sense within the context of my last comment i do not understand why you are so steadfast about using a term what no actual organisation uses where have i used the term here all i have done is argued is that it is not racist to refer to a virus by where it originated which is a fairly common practice which is predominantly used by racists do you have a single bit of evidence to suggest that the majority of people who use that term are racists or are you using your opinion of people who use that term is it really too much of burden to call it covid or coronavirus no more of a burden than calling it wuhan flu or a chinese virus,518.0115387351032,1759.454691125325,9827.75332094968,17554.3093074788
joke cent armyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicentparty reputation points with the ccp faction gives you cool perks back home the cent party or cent army chinese often shortened as wmo is a colloquial term for internet commentators chinese who are hired by authorities of the peoples republic of china in an attempt to manipulate public opinion to the benefit of the chinese communist party it was created during the early phases of the internets rollout to the wider public in china the name derives from the allegation that commentators are said to be paid for every post though some speculate that they are probably not paid anything for the posts instead being required to do so as a part of their official party duties they create favourable comments or articles on popular chinese social media networks that are intended to derail discussions that are unhelpful to the communist party and that promote narratives that serve the governments interests together with disparaging comments and misinformation about political opponents and critics of the chinese government both domestic and abroad it is also used as a derogatory term against people with perceived proccp or chinese nationalist views,1406.0783166274327,4693.14520856078,19138.541092868607,26781.19607842138

aww poor thing peoples experiences too real for you too tough to think about i have been to auschwitz and dachau and seen the photos and marks on the walls where people were gassed and tried to escape yes i have actually also been to the nanjing victims memorial too and it is important to recognize those events as well i do not need to look at that every day to know if it is being mentioned that it is probably being remembered and that is not a bad thing if just seeing gore and violence on the internet triggers you this much my suggestion is to think about those who had to experience it first hand and seek out empathy history is important to remember what are you doing on reddit at work if you can not look at bad things at work i am not butt hurt when they get mentioned and remembered online this is not nearly the most graphic thing that randomly pops up on the front page now and then even with nsfw spoilers shit gets through i find it a little ridiculous that thumbnails of injuries and bodies makes you this uncomfortable at work if you are frequently on this subreddit or the internet at in general while working your pretend outrage over these pictures is weird violent images in our own news media dominate this is no worse than on the morning of a school shooting or one of the protests of the last year,765.6526733166648,2979.116829395747,16397.98015806437,28353.921022584538
in my view it is the opposite bush was the worst for starting the war and having no coherent plan for it then fucking things up on the ground in innumerable ways obama was second worst for pointlessly extending the war for years and escalating it while continuing to have no coherent strategy also both bush and obama lied constantly about how badly things were going trump is rd worst he got the ball rolling on withdrawal but was too cowardly to make the final decision and increased air strikes to no effect other than mass civilian casualties for yearsbidens execution of the withdrawal was flawed but of the four presidents who presided over the disastrous war he deserves the least blame in my view,1401.1797149562472,6001.133083353889,21840.804120172037,26097.964111263278

uhh the list is not from me i am just using it because it came from a profession who probably knows a lot more political theory then i do and the reason why phrases like western enlightened views sounds to altright is because neonaziism is an extension or logical conclusion if you will of the altright i do not believe the ccp has value for liberty and if they do they do not demonstrate it through their politics as far as i am concerned but values like such are not openly rejected in their preachings to the public which do not get me wrong is obviously a victim we can keep talking about the conception of modernism postmodernism and neotraditionalism if you would like and there is certainly a point to be made there and i have a little bit of knowledge regarding the subject xb i would like to concede as i have changed my mind i did not think this through when i first commented but the ccp clearly appeal to the middle class via spreading this idea of the ideal middle class being nationalist and as a leftist any nationalist positivity is harmful and should be opposed xb oh by the way would you mind me asking your political standing just curious,753.3865934338958,2503.954463310543,14856.382875518815,27153.77163659

i suppose they end to skip over that part in a lot of the holocaust films but i think it was significant that they did not so much in schindlers list there is this exchange right toward the end where this russian soldier is all like you have been liberated in the name of the soviet red army and he sounds kind of foolish since schindler already talked all the nazi guards into leaving and returning to their homes so that the remaining jews were already liberated but one of them ben kingsley i think asks okay so where do we go now and the russian soldier does not quite know at first he has a moment of humanity and empathy and warns them not to go east they hate you guys out there but he finally directs them to a village in the other direction the schindler jews start walking in that direction only for the picture to fade into the real life schindler jews in israel where they are leaving stones on the grave of oskar schindler so they did not come right out and say that things were still rough for the survivors in but it was an interesting moment i believe originally i was under the impression that as soon as the camps were liberated everything was okay that the american british free french and soviet armies took care of them and they all got to go back home oh my sweet summer child,902.4548862023504,3136.3915872231655,18629.124031355685,28214.243071973

not sure about ai but i agree with the rest of this we will see how rapidly and effectively ai is implemented you may be right my view is that his binary and the ideas of his generation are rooted in education from that period it is a lot harder to say how many people in younger generations ie todays teachers and students share his completely black and white views but i get the sense that the number of trained thinkers not only capable of nuance but who embrace it are very limited in most of the country i do get the sense that among city dwellers and some more educated folks they are far more common and more advanced than these folks who tend to only think in black and white but they are still not extremely common among academics i get the sense that extremely nuanced thinking is more common but there is still an overwhelming tendency to stick to black and white i really want people to embrace nuance but it is not an easy thing to teach i think it is best learned by looking at others examples and that is not exactly a widespread thing at the moment,711.0971348928751,2789.194734412936,14170.521942610712,24638.550723409913

does not that reflect more so on american citizens rather than these individual companies i agree with you that companies only care about profit so van is supporting the george floyd protest because american people care more about justice for floyd and will punish companies for not taking a stand meanwhile they will drop pro hk sneakers because not enough american consumers will take a stand with hk to do the opposite apple and tesla both expanded their businesses in china after the hong kong protests and i have yet saw any boycotts i have seen this sub bash the shit out of terry crew and lebron james doing businesses in china but still using their damn iphones so the most powerful corporations can open up businesses in a brutal oppressive regime that is cool but god help us if some black self made millionaires do a deal to further their investment what a fucking joke,1216.587133003696,5237.107807552497,20857.327328736585,26437.654029753376

i am an attorney who represents siv clients special immigrant visa which you can get if you assisted the united states we have been complaining for years that the siv approval process is way too slow anyways the pro bono organization my law firm partnered with had started talks about evacuating at least two months ago both people with siv approval and those whose applications were still pending since approval takes forever but we were told the situation would be stable for a few more months and so it never really got off the ground now obviously its chaos most of our clients are not in kabul and have no safe way to get to kabul or any other way out of their townvillage they are sheltering in place at least we hope we lost touch with several clients in the last few days for those in kabul we are trying to arrange transport out as you have seen in the news a lot of siv holders made it to fort lee va for those with siv applications still pending who do not yet qualify for a visa to the us we are trying to set up a temporary facility in qatar where people can wait safely but who knows what will happen it absolutely breaks my heart knowing many of our clients are probably already deadedit as you have probably seen in the news the us will try and bring siv applicants to the us unclear what that means or how they will accomplish it no plans at the moment for many of these applicants who do not live in or near kabul and have no way of getting to the kabul airport,1108.7310811574541,3161.2590735848134,18046.31295515517,29820.232492611485
you seem to be very passionate about this topic for some reason because i lived there for five years i made many local friends i listened to their perspectives i empathized with their fears and hardships all we know from this video is that the uyghur girl is not allowed to speak other languages in school because it is a mandarin school and she does not have any other alternative there are no more true uyghur schools just nominal bilingual schools that restrict minority languages to a very small part of the curriculum in which speaking uyghur outside of those select classes is still not allowed there used to be many successful uyghurrun private language training schools but as far as i am aware most if not all of them have been shut down who cares what she speaks outside of school obviously she can speak uyghur with her parents she could also be immersed with uyghur on the streets in supermakets on the tv etc but she will not speak it with people her age as she and the rest of her cohorts are already being conditioned against it i already see it large groups of kids all uyghur or all kazakh but all speaking together in mandarin because the conditioning they recieve in school does not end when the bell rings i do not know what your background is but what you said does hit home a little since i am chinesecanadian and i can tell you the people around me only speak english they do not really care about keeping their heritage language because let us face it why should they they grew up in an english speaking environment and they communicate and work in english if you want to preserve your heritage language you are able to there are chinese language training schools popping up all over the place and nobody restricts them you have china taiwan singapore and many overseas communities that speak your language it is in no risk of dying out still canada is an immigrant country aside from the of indigenous people whose cultures and languages have already been dealt a great deal of damage from colonialism and that horribly misguided boarding school policy canadians are mostly immigrants or descendants of immigrants they chose to move there uyghurs did not choose to live in a mandarindominant country they only have one homeland one bastion of their culture their situation is not the same as yours people strive for a good life so they would ditch their own language for a language that is more useful this unfortunately is an effect of globalization and a developing society imagine if you were a uyghur parent would you want your child to have a life with less opportunities by sending her to a uyghur school or would you send her to a han school the uyghurs i know all want to preserve their cultural identity you seem to believe what is going on is by the uyghurs own will rather than something being forced upon them the douyin page seems normal too does not look like a ccp propaganda page just some year old girls teachers profile and that is the scary part that video is deleted for some reason though apparently she got a lot of backlash she does not have many followers all she needed was backlash from one chain of higherups seeking to delete something that sheds a negative light on what they are doing but you are reading too much into one video no the video goes handinhand with my own experiences there is a lot of misinformation about the plight of the uyghurs a lot of videos that have nothing to do with the uyghurs being mislabelled as misrepresented as evidence of the uyghur situation which actually just serve to discredit all allegations by those with a proccp bias then you will have videos like this impossible to deny and the same people arguing that china works hard to promote uyghur culture and language have suddenly changed their tune claiming that the erasure of uyghur language and culture is justifiable in the name of ethnic unity which only serves to confirm the same fears they were denying a week before before there was a question of whether or not cultural genocide was real or not now the conversation has shifted to the extremes of whether the cultural genocide is good or evil,848.3947247540481,3244.578729356138,15751.178633859074,24279.138655708968

i do get the point of view you are sharing here i am often angry at the afghan army for what seems to me like straight up cowardice but then i remember that that judgement comes from a cushy life where i have never had to make the kind of decisions that the average afghan company or division commander has to make right now how would we act if the taliban was closing in on our city and we had no support from the government and our soldiers had to go up against high morale toughened guerrilla fighters with no mercy for the afghan army i honestly do not know bro id like to think id stay and fight to the death but i do not know,619.4559675348829,1835.8086831579083,12742.380180921453,23714.763660377313

there is sometimes a thing that christians do where they try to define who is and who is not a real christian i remember in high school some of the evangelical kids would ask people are you a christian or are you a catholic and mormons could tell you quite a bit about how other christians often define them out of being christian i find that it often depends on how well regarded the group is if it is a group of people we like even if they are not our sect they are christian but if they are weird or do awful things then they are not real christians just like the whole no true scotsman problem that all being said certainly the taiping folks were at best highly heterodox christians i would say that there were certainly some christian beliefs that their sect incorporated but they were too idiosyncratic to be simply described as christians i mean if you are going around claiming to be the literal brother of jesus well that is not going to work for christianity if we understand xtianity to describe jesus as the one and only son of god one needs a description of christianity that does not just mean belief in the divinity of jesus because by that standard muslims and bahai would also count as christians,772.3811214783057,3015.943241124094,15689.55631365516,26327.716147826137

sad but i can not blame them its a few hundred men congested in a valley with limited firearms everything is against them at the moment yes one might hope that a population that has experienced some degree of education and freedom over the past years will not just roll over to the taliban and in that case its wise to establish a small pocket of resistance in case that hits critical mass already there are protests in major cities and fighters took back some cities in baghlan also dostum and atta have not been heard from since mazar fell and they will make or break any resistance atta sent his son to the jamiat negotiations dostum very distinctly did not of course this is all wishful thinking on my part the deck is very much stacked against the panjshiris hence the negotiations but everything in afg politics is temporary and if they reach a deal its only for now what would an inclusive government mean for the taliban anywaymillion dollar question to the negotiators it will mean representation and therefore protection for ethnic minorities to the taliban it will mean horseshit,1008.3513213430962,3345.6599281627623,14074.66493170005,19454.016065398766

not getting ratings is one factor to why this happens but logistics is an even bigger one journalists from any country very rarely cover a conflict that their own country does not have a presence in because its more difficult and expensive to get the information to report on along with being far more dangerous when you can not be airlifted out by your own military as is very common for war correspondents and though it can be hard to believe sometimes most media has pretty high standards of reporting on conflicts and pretty much do not write or show something they can not verify firsthand which means if they can not get boots on the ground they will not cover it that the countries with these conflicts rarely have a significant established journalism presence of their own plays a big role too otherwise their reporting could be used abroad but not a whole lot exists in the more rural afghan provinces or in yemen as you mention,781.5607648187672,3203.1911121704375,17477.54319366562,26565.63990557141

taiwan is not independent it is still being colonised by china but it is fighting for its freedom i think it is crucial to recognise the fact that the republic of china in taiwan is not actually an independent taiwanese government in fact it is an exiled chinese government which has colonised taiwan originally the republic of china was almost synonymous with the kuomintang chinese nationalists however nowadays it is true that the native taiwanese have infiltrated the ranks of the republic of china and are now sort of governing themselves they are still fighting against the chinese institutions which have been established in their country but at least nowadays they have the capacity to fight at all in the past they had no power whatsoever the taiwanese have been fighting against the republic of china and the kuomintang through democratic processes rather than violence i think the law which was passed to legalise samesex marriage should be considered taiwanese though because it was the independenceoriented democratic progressive party which passed the bill rather than the kuomintang colonisers the kuomintang was actually the main force in taiwan which was opposed to the passing of the bill around seven kuomintang legislators refused to tout the party line and decided to vote in favour of samesex marriage these people are now being expelled from the kuomintang despite the fact that the kuomintang never indicated that it would do this if they did not support the party line the kuomintang is the main political party within taiwan which believes that taiwan belongs to china the chinese communist party has no official presence within taiwan,822.3747027894356,2283.145545502718,13916.810654972818,26076.50567025922

you have said two wrongs do not make a right multiple times if two wrongs do not make a right why are you belittling someone for speaking about themselves you are doing what you say is so wrong this once again is not a straw man argument i am drawing upon many things you have already said that attack this persons character as i said this is a straw man you have come across as sexist by out right defending women about intentionally changing their outward appearance for social gains and saying any man who inflates their earning in conversation is a bad person what is the worst outcome from either scenario without extenuating factors all i see is someone having a bruised ego at the end of the day even if i do believe it is hogwash it is not an argument i am going to dive into again because it does not justify the original position that said inferring a position is not the same as outright defending women about intentionally changing their outward appearance for social gains and saying any man who inflates their earning in conversation is a bad person because i have not outright defended that and i am not going to,858.563677763031,2201.6485248077975,9278.918277880965,16111.209708726265

i have a better idea how about ask what human rights watchdogs and intergovernmental agencies who monitor genocide what genocide means that is not how language works though people are not posting links for human rights watchdogs to see if what you mean is using the word genocide is deliberately putting the wrong image in peoples heads yes language is descriptive english specially so there is no central institution that regulates what words mean words mean what most people say it means,1114.2109031194298,3434.3547667205817,9958.430416189556,12836.683674404167

nobody is trusting anybody its a simple fact that the taliban are de facto in charge of the country and the nrf has practically zero chance of maintaining control of anything more than their tiny pocket of landnobody is saying we should trust pakistan the taliban the haqqanis etcwe definitely should not they are a much bigger threat to the us and it just does not benefit us to draw their ireyoure letting your emotions get the best of your judgement here we all want the nrf to hold out and win but its just not in our national interest to risk a working relationship with the taliban just to support the resistance,759.0995244676345,2258.541648946578,14494.599736680719,23256.74634135093
that is what happens during a chaotic situation if someone is goes in a crowded theater and shout fire someone might end up getting killed in the stampede of people trying to do the rational thing of running away as fast as they can but you would not blame the crowd you would blame the person who shouted fire or focus on him in chaotic situations the fault almost entirely lies with the first persons who did the irrational thing when people start hearing gun fire and see tanks surrounding them they might assume anyone not on their side is trying to kill them they might rationally assume it is a kill or be killed situation no one who hears gunfire around him and sees tanks surrounding him thinks oh look goverment just wants to have peaceful negotiations or i am sure if i ask nicely they will let me go home without shooting me or arresting me and eventually executing me,1129.3933784221924,4199.247396160791,19182.95681220455,25999.462269143365
